As many diseases have similarities in clinical presentation differential diag-nosis becomes crucial for making the right clinical diagnosis. For example, physical signs of pulmonary consolidation are present in several conditions involving not only lungs but also cardiovascular system, i.e. pneumonia, primary and metastatic lung cancer, congestive heart failure etc. The impor-tance of differential diagnosis is emphasized by the fact that the right diag-nosis is the key for the efficient treatment.\\nThe authors strongly believe that this manual would be useful not only \\nfor medical students but also for medical residents of different specialities and practitioners.'),\n",

In fact, this is the first work written in the Republic of Moldova which is entirely dedicated to the problem of differential diagnosis.\\nThe topics in this textbook corresponds to the Curriculum for the Dis-\\ncipline of Internal Medicine – Clinical synthesis and include Differential diagnosis of chest pain, Differential diagnosis of pulmonary consolidation syndrome, Differential diagnosis of edema etc. Each topic is described according to a certain plan: introduction, definition, pathophysiology, clas-sification, diagnostic approach, differential diagnosis (with a brief descrip-tion of the most important clinical and paraclinical features of every dis-ease) and bibliography.\\nSince the differential diagnosis is the first clinical exercise after obtain-\\ning the clinical history and the results of the basic and complementary examinations, this book has a sharp focus on essential information with a goal of providing clear answers to clinical questions in internal medicine. As many diseases have similarities in clinical presentation differential diag-nosis becomes crucial for making the right clinical diagnosis. For example, physical signs of pulmonary consolidation are present in several conditions involving not only lungs but also cardiovascular system, i.e. pneumonia, primary and metastatic lung cancer, congestive heart failure etc. The impor-tance of differential diagnosis is emphasized by the fact that the right diag-nosis is the key for the efficient treatment.\\nThe authors strongly believe that this manual would be useful not only \\nfor medical students but also for medical residents of different specialities and practitioners.\\n\\n6\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL

Chest pain is a syndrome that can be in different \\npathologies and is considered a medical emergency. Chest pain of cardiac \\nor noncardiac origin – this is often a diagnosis of exclusion made after rul-ing out more serious causes of the pain. The list includes 440 causes of chest pain that range from non-serious to life-threatening. Chest pain can origi-nate from all organs of the thorax. The most common causes of chest pain in adults include: gastrointestinal (42%), coronary artery (31%), musculoskel-etal disease (28%), pericarditis (4%) and pulmonary embolism (2%).\\nCommon causes of chest pain:Cardiovascular causes: acute myocardial infarction, acute coronary \\nischemia, aortic dissection, cardiac tamponade, unstable angina, coronary spasm, Prinzmetal's angina, cocaine– induced chest pain, pericarditis, myo-carditis, valvular heart disease, aortic stenosis, mitral valve prolapse, hyper-trophic cardiomyopathy.\\nPulmonary causes: pulmonary embolus, pneumothorax, pleuritis, \\ntumor, mediastinits, pneumomediastinum.\\nGastrointestinal causes: esophageal rupture (Boerhaave`s syndrome), \\nesophageal tear (Mallory-Weiss syndrome), cholecystitis, pancreatitis, esophageal spasm, esophageal reflux, peptic ulcer, biliary colic, dyspepsia, splenic infarction.\\nMusculoskeletal causes: muscle strain, costochondritis, nonspecific \\nchest wall pain, arthritis, tumor, rib fracture, cervical disk disease, fibromy-algia.\\nNeurologic causes: spinal root compression, Herpes zoster, posther-\\npetic neuralgia, thoracic outlet.\\nOther causes: psychologic, hyperventilation.Less common causes include: lung cancer and aortic aneurysms.More than 50% of people presenting to emergency facilities with unex-\\nplained chest pain will have coronary disease ruled out. In the coronar-ies the prevalence of typical ischemic chest pain was reported in 14% and atypical chest pain – 24%.\\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY. The inner chest organs: heart, blood vessels, \\nesophagus and visceral pleura are innervated by visceral fibers, that enter the spinal cord at several levels leading to poorly localized, poorly charac-\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE17\\nterized pain (discomfort). As dorsal fibers can overlap three levels above \\nor below, thoracic pain can be produce and irradiate from the jaw to the epigastria. In contrast to visceral pain, parietal pain, is sharp and can be localized to the dermatome superficial to the site of the painful stimulus. The dermis and parietal pleura are innervated by parietal fibers.\\nCLASSIFICATION OF CHEST PAINI. Cardiac chest pain (heart-related)– ischemic chest pain\\n– non-ischemic chest pain\\nII. Non-cardiac chest pain.DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS of ischemic cardiac and non-car-\\ndiac chest pain\\nIschemic cardiac pain. Symptoms of acute chest pain, those with a \\nhigher intensity of pain had a higher likelihood of developing acute myo-cardial infarction. Patients with acute coronary syndrome mostly describe their pain as diffuse over a wide area of the anterior chest wall and not local-ized. The pain might radiate to the left and/or right arm as well as to the neck and back. History and symptom evaluation should be based on type, severity, reference, response to posture/movement, response to food/fluid, tenderness, response to nitroglycerin and associated symptoms in order to decide whether a patient with chest pain has a dangerous condition.\\nNon-cardiac chest pain is a chest pain without evidence of coronary \\nheart diesease in conventional diagnostic evaluation. The prevalence of non-cardiac chest pain is up to 70%. These are musculoskeletal in 40%, gastrointestinal in 20%, psychiatric in 10% and pulmonary and mediastinal diseases in 5% of cases. The gastroenterological spectrum includes: gas-troesophageal reflux disease (GERD) in 60%, hypercontractile esophageal motility disorders, achalasia in 20% and other esophagitis in 30%.\\nAssociated symptoms: Chest pain that occurs in acute coronary syn-\\ndrome is generally accompanied by autonomic nervous system stimulation. The patient often appears pale, diaphoretic and cool to touch. Acute pain with associated vegetative symptoms should put the patient on the fast track with any diagnosis. Associated symptoms should be assessed together with signs of other diseases, such as infection, fever, anxiety and nervous-ness.\\nDifferential diagnosis of chest pain by localization includes important \\nskin areas for referral of chest pain:\\n\\n18\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINERetrosternal\\n– Myocardial ischemic pain\\n– Pericardial pain\\n– Esophageal pain\\n– Aortic dissection\\n– Mediastinal lesions\\n– Pulmonary embolism\\nArms– Myocardial ischemic pain\\n– Pericarditis\\n– Subdiaphragmatic abscess\\n– Diaphragmal pleurisy\\n– Cervical spine disease\\n– Acute musculoskeletal pain\\n– Thoracic outlet syndrome\\nInterscapular– Myocardial ischemic pain\\n– Musculoskeletal pain\\n– Gallbladder pain\\n– Pancreatic pain\\nEpigastric– Myocardial ischemic pain\\n– Pericardial pain\\n– Esophageal pain\\n– Duodenal/gastric pain\\n– Gallbladder pain\\n– Pancreatic pain\\n– Distention of the liver\\n– Diaphragmatic pleurisy\\n– Pneumonia/pleurisy\\nRight lower chest– Gallbladder pain\\n– Distention of the liver\\n– Subdiaphragmatic abscess\\n– Pneumonia/pleurisy\\n– Gastric or duodenal penetrating ulcer\\n– Pulmonary embolism\\n– Acute myositis\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE19\\n– Injuries\\nLeft lower chest\\n– Intercostal neuralgia\\n– Pulmonary embolism\\n– Myositis\\n– Pneumonia/pleurisy\\n– Splenic infarction\\n– Splenic flexure syndrome\\n– Subdiaphragmatic abscess\\n– Precordial catch syndrome\\n– Injuries.\\nVariables indicating a very low risk of development of unstable angina \\npectoris or myocardial infarction are sharp or stabbing pain, no history of angina pectoris or myocardial infarction, pain with pleuritic or positional components and pain that was reproduced by palpation of the chest wall.\\nDiagnostic tests in acute chest painIn patients with acute chest pain the diagnostic procedure should serve \\ntwo major purposes:\\n1) to identify quickly high risk patients for the fast track;\\n2) to delineate patients in whom there is little or no suspicion of a life-threatening disease.\\n12-lead ECG is a readily available and is considered a standard of care \\nand always be recorded in patients suffering from acute chest pain if the cause of the pain is not sufficiently clear from the patients’ history and physical examination.\\nBiochemical markers, particularly troponins in combination with \\nCK-MB serves as markers of myocardial necrosis.\\nImaging techniques (chest radiography, 2D-echocardiography, radio-\\nnuclide imaging, angiocoronarography) are helpful in identifying low-risk patients, who can be eligible for early discharge or undergo early stress testing.\\nLife– threatening causes of chest pain include:1. Acute coronary syndromes\\n2. Pericarditis with tamponade\\n3. Aortic dissection\\n4. Pulmonary embolus\\n5. Tension pneumothorax\\n6. Esophageal rupture.\\n\\n20\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF LIFE THREATENING \\nCAUSES OF CHEST PAIN\\n1. Acute coronary syndrome (ACS)ACS refers to life-threatening conditions: acute myocardial ischemia \\nand/or infarction that are due to an acute decrease in coronary blood ﬂow.\\nClassification. ACS includes the clinical picture of coronary artery dis-\\nease: chest pain, ECG changes and increase in cardiac biochemical mark-ers. The spectrum spans from unstable angina pectoris to transmural myo-cardial infarction. ACS is divided into two large categories, each of which requires a specific treatment strategy.\\n• ACS with ST segment elevation (ST segment elevation myocardial \\ninfarction, STEMI) or new, left bundle branch block (LBBB): in these patients the coronary artery is most likely totally occluded.\\n• ACS without ST segment elevation (NSTEMI): the ECG changes \\ninclude transient ST segment elevation, ST segment depression, T wave inversions, and other changes of repolarization. This category also includes patients who do not show any ECG changes despite ischemic chest pain and, conversely, patients who show ischemic ECG changes but do not complain of chest discomfort. NSTEMI can be further subdivided on the \\nbasis of cardiac biomarkers of necrosis. If cardiac biomarkers are elevated and the clinical context is appropriate, the patient is considered to have NSTEMI, the patient is deemed to have unstable angina. ST depression, transient ST-elevation, and/or prominent T-wave inversions may be pres-ent but are not required for a diagnosis of NSTEMI. Abnormalities on the ECG and elevated troponins in isolation are insufficient to make the diag-nosis of ACS but must be interpreted in the appropriate clinical context.\\nEvaluation and diagnosis are based on the history of pain, physical \\nexamination, electrocardiogram, and cardiac biochemical markers. The leading symptom of ACS is chest pain, most commonly as a pressure-type chest pain that typically occurs at rest or with minimal exertion. The pain most frequently starts in the retrosternal area and can radiate to either or both arms, the neck, or the jaw. The pain may also occur in these areas independent of chest pain. Associated symptoms are: diaphoresis, dyspnea, nausea, abdominal pain, or syncope. Unexplained new-onset or increased exertional dyspnea is the most common angina equivalent. Less com-mon presentations include nausea and vomiting, diaphoresis, unexplained fatigue, and syncope.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE21\\nThe factors that increase the probability of acute coronary syndrome are \\nolder age, male sex, positive family history of coronary artery disease, and \\nthe presence of peripheral arterial disease, diabetes mellitus, renal insuffi-ciency, prior myocardial infarction, and prior coronary revascularization. Although older male patients (≥75 years) and females usually present with typical symptoms of acute coronary syndrome, the frequency of atypi-cal presentations is increased in these groups as well as in patients with diabetes mellitus, impaired renal function, and dementia. Atypical symp-toms, including epigastric pain, indigestion, stabbing or pleuritic pain, and increased dyspnea in the absence of chest pain should cause concern of ACS.\\nResting ECG. The ST-segment elevation (measured at the J-point) \\nis considered suggestive of ongoing coronary artery acute occlusion in the following cases: at least two contiguous leads with ST-segment elevation ≥ 2.5 mm in men < 40 years, ≥2 mm in men ≥ 40 years, or ≥ 1.5 mm in women \\nin leads V\\n2–V3 and/or ≥ 1 mm in the other leads [in the absence of left ven-\\ntricular (LV) hypertrophy or left bundle branch block LBBB]. The ST-seg-ment depression in leads V\\n1–V3 suggests myocardial ischaemia, especially \\nwhen the terminal T-wave is positive (ST-segment elevation equivalent), and confirmation by concomitant ST-segment elevation ≥ 0.5 mm recorded \\nin leads V\\n7–V9 should be considered as a means to identify posterior myo-\\ncardial infarction.\\nNon-diagnostic ECG. Some patients with an acute coronary occlu-\\nsion may have an initial ECG without ST-segment elevation, sometimes because they are seen very early after the symptom onset (in this case, one should look for hyperacute T-waves, which may precede ST-segment ele-vation). It is important to repeat the ECG or monitor for dynamic ST-seg-ment changes. In addition, there is a concern that some patients with acute occlusion of the coronary artery and ongoing MI, as well as those with an occluded circumflex coronary artery, acute occlusion of a vein graft, or left main disease, may present without ST-segment elevation and be denied reperfusion therapy, resulting in a larger infarction and worse outcomes. Extending the standard 12-lead ECG with V\\n7–V9 leads may identify some \\nof these patients. In any case, suspicion of ongoing myocardial ischaemia is an indication for a primary PCI strategy even in patients without diagnos-tic ST-segment elevation.\\nThe exercise ECG is recorded during exercise on a bicycle or a tread-\\nmill. The test is clinically positive if angina pectoris occurs. It is electro-\\n\\n22\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEcardiographically positive if there is either an ST segment depression of \\nat least 0.1 mV (subendocardial ischemia) or a transient monophasic ST segment elevation (transmural ischemia). Extensive ST segment depres-sions in several leads, simultaneous with a drop in blood pressure, or the occurrence of anginal symptoms at a low exercise level, are indications of a severe coronary artery disease.\\nEchocardiography allows the visualization of heart wall motion abnor-\\nmalities caused by chronic or acute ischemia, and scars of old infarcts. In chronic stable angina pectoris, stress echocardiography is used to look for stress-induced heart wall motion abnormalities as a sign of a significant ischemic coronary artery disease. Dobutamin in increased doses is infused to stress the heart in a stress echocardiography.\\nMyocardial scintigraphy. Radionuclide tracers allow the visualization \\nof regional differences in coronary flow during exercise. Thallium 201, technetium 99 mTc-labeled sestamibi and 99 mTc-labeled tetrofosmin are radionucleotide tracers currently in use. The tracers are taken up by myo-cardial cells in proportion to coronary flow. A fixed defect is recorded in regions of an old infarct. Regions with exercise-induced ischemia exhibit reversible uptake deficits. Thallium 201 has the property to accumulate in the myocardial cells over several hours. This allows to test whether the myocardium in the area of a defect is still viable. Late accumulation of thallium (12-24 hours after initial test) is an indication for viability of the myocardium, despite reduced coronary flow.\\nPositron Emission Tomography (PET). Myocardial scintigraphy \\ndetects only relative differences in perfusion. PET allows the measurement of absolute coronary flows. In addition to the detection of perfusion defi-cits, viability can be tested with tracers that are incorporated in metabolic pathways of the myocardial cells. Therefore, PET has become the „gold standard” to test for viability in hypoperfused, hypocontractile myocar-dial areas. In addition, PET can now be combined with high resolution computed tomography. Thus, a coronary stenosis can be visualized and the physiological effect of the stenosis can be assessed simultaneously.\\nMagnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). MRI not only discloses the \\nanatomical structures of the heart and coronary arteries, it is also capable of measuring absolute coronary blood flow. Changes in MR properties of ischemic myocardium allow the detection of a significant number of coro-nary artery diseases. In addition, scar tissue can be unequivocally identified and precisely quantified.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE23\\nCoronary angiography. In case of proven or suspected myocardial \\nischemia, coronary angiography is indispensable for visualization of the \\ncoronary anatomy and stenoses. The anatomic severity of a coronary steno-sis is, however, not always predictive of its physiologic effect. In a stenosis of unclear significance the physiologic effect, and therefore the clinical rel-evance, can be assessed by measuring the fractional coronary flow reserve. This is done by measuring the drop in pressure and/or flow over the ste-nosis at rest and after maximal vasodilation with adenosine. In chronic stable angina pectoris a coronary angiography is performed if a coronary revascularization is considered. A diagnostic coronary angiography should also be performed if the noninvasive tests are not equivocal in all patients with heart failure. In patients with unstable angina pectoris a timely inva-sive evaluation is advisable.\\n2. Aortic dissection. An aortic dissection has to be considered in case \\nof acute substernal tearing sensation, with radiation to interscapular region of the back; pain may migrate with the propagation of the dissection in the back or radiating to the back; stroke; acute myocardial infarction, due to the obstruction of aortic branches; dyspnoea due to acute aortic regurgitation; hypotension due to cardiac tamponade. Aortic dissection occurs most com-monly in the sixth or seventh decade of life. Hypertension, aortic athero-sclerosis which are present in 80% of the patients and previous surgery of \\nthe aorta: coronary bypass operation or aortic valve replacement are predis-posing factors. Aortic dissection may, however, occur in other patients. The main risk factor in the young is aortic diseases with medial degeneration: Marfan syndrome, Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, coarctation of the aorta, or fibromuscular dysplasia. In younger women, about 50% of cases of aortic dissection occur during pregnancy in the third trimester. Aortic dissec-tions can also be caused by trauma or iatrogenic injuries, by catheters, or an intra-aortic balloon pump.\\nAortic dissection results from a tear in the intima, such that blood pene- \\ntrates between the intimal layer and the media of the aortic wall. This cre-ates a false lumen in the arterial wall. Typically a second tear of the intima creates the exit for the blood. This exit site can be located in the ascending aorta, in the descending aorta, or the iliac vessels. Compression of the trun-cus brachiocephalicus results in a pulse deficit and blood pressure diffe- rence between the right and the left arm. Less frequent complications are: the compression of the coronary arteries resulting in myocardial infarction, rupture of the dissection into the pericardial space with pericardial tam-\\n\\n24\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEponade, hematothorax, rupture of the descending aorta with bleeding into \\nthe mediastinum or abdomen, a compression of the renal arteries with sub-sequent acute renal failure, mesenteric infarction with an acute abdomen due to the compression of the celiac and/or superior mesenteric artery, and acute limb ischemia secondary to the obstruction of the flow in the arteria iliaca. The rupture of the aorta is the most common cause of death. Aortic dissection must be suspected in patients presenting with widened medi-astinum on chest radiograph. The diagnosis is confirmed by transesopha-geal echocardiography: false lumen or flap in the ascending or descending \\naorta; new aortic regurgitation or pericardial tamponade. Chest CT with contrast or MRI angiography confirms false lumen or flap in the ascend-ing or descending aorta.\\n3. Pericardial tamponade. The main clinical sign of pericardial tam-\\nponade is persistent, sharp, severe, stabbing, tearing, varying with respira-tion, position, and motion (increasing pain in recumbency and with deep inspiration or coughing), precordial chest pain. The associated signs are: hypotension, distended jugular veins, distended liver, and pulsus paradoxus. The tamponade of the pericardium occurs with a rupture of the free wall after myocardial infarction, tuberculosis, iatrogenic (invasive procedure-re-lated, post-cardac surgery), trauma, neoplasm, malignancy, colagen vascular diseases, radiation induced, uraemia, aortic dissection, bacterial infecion and pneumopericardium. The diagnosis is made by echocardiography: peri- cardial effusion causing collapse of great vessels, atria, and ventricles.\\n4. Pulmonary embolism. Chest pain is sharp and pleuritic in nature; \\ndyspnoea; haemoptysis may occur if pulmonary infarction develops; syn-cope. Risk factors: history of immobilisation, orthopaedic procedures, oral contraceptive use, previous pulmonary embolism, fever, deep venous thrombosis. Associated signs: tachycardia, loud P2, right-sided S4 gallop, jugular venous distention, hypotension, tachypnea. The ECG shows a rota-tion of the frontal QRS axis to the right, S1, Q3, and T3 pattern.The chest radiograph may show decreased perfusion in a segment of pulmonary vas-culature; wedge-shaped or linear opacities of any size or shape, pleural effu-sion, or an elevated hemidiaphragm. Blood gases show low PaO2 and low PaCO2. D-dimers are elevated in the plasma (500 ng/L). Echocardiogra-phy may show acute right ventricular dilation or hypokinesis. The diagno-\\nsis of pulmonary embolism is most often confirmed by a CT pulmonary angiography– may identify thrombus in the pulmonary artery.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE25\\n5. Tension pneumothorax is a life-threatening complication of pneu-\\nmothorax with sudden onset of sharp, tearing, acute, pleuritic, unilateral \\nchest pain, variable with respiration, accompanied by increasing dysp-noea and shock. Spontaneous tension pneumothorax is an extremely rare event and usually occurs in the lungs with a distinct underlying pathol-ogy: COPD, traumatic due to acute trauma or iatrogenic. If the pressure inside the pneumothorax rises above the atmospheric, as it may occur with a one-way leak into the pleural space or it occurs as a complication of pos-itive pressure ventilation, a tension pneumothorax is present. The mediasti-num shifts toward the unaffected side, and cardiac output may be severely compromised due to the positive intrathoracic pressure decreasing venous return to the heart. The exam reveals: absent breath sounds, increased res-onance to percussion, jugular venous distention, trachea deviation, and hypotension due to the compromise of the great vessels. The diagnosis is \\nconfirmed by chest radiography: air in the pleural space, visible pleural line from collapsed lung, or mediastinal shift.\\n6. Esophageal rupture is characterized by an excruciating, sharp precor-\\ndial pain, radiating to back, usually after vomiting, followed by fever and shock. The most common cause of esophageal perforation is postemetic with high mortality trauma, including postoperative trauma, medical instrumentation for diagnostic and therapeutic endeavors. The mediastinal pleura often ruptures, and gastric fluid is drawn into the pleural space by the negative intrathoracic pressure. This pleural effusion usually is on the left but can be bilateral. Double-contrast esophageal barium studies are recommended as the initial imaging study.\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\n1.

The prevalence of heart failure (HF) depends on \\nthe definition applied, but is approximately 1–2% of the adult population \\nin developed countries, rising to ≥10% among people >70 years of age.\\nDEFINITION. Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by \\ntypical symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle swelling and fatigue) that may be accompanied by signs (e.g. elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles and peripheral oedema) caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality, resulting in a reduced cardiac output and/or elevated intracardiac pressures at rest or during stress.\\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY. HF with a reduced ejection fraction (EF) \\nappears when there is decreased left ventricular (LV) stroke volume. The pumping capacity of the heart on three interrelated factors:\\n• preload or venous return,\\n• myocardial contractility,\\n• afterload (impedance to forward flow).\\nAny condition that impairs one or more of these factors can produce \\nheart failure. A number of compensatory mechanisms become activated in the presence of cardiac injury and/or LV dysfunction allowing patients to sustain and modulate LV function for a period of months to years.\\nThe compensatory mechanisms include:• activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) and adren-ergic nervous systems, which are responsible, respectively, for main-taining cardiac output through increased retention of salt and water,\\n• increased myocardial contractility.\\nThere is an activation of vasodilatory molecules, including the atrial and \\nbrain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP), prostaglandins (PGE and PGI), and nitric oxide (NO), that counterpoise the excessive peripheral vascular vasoconstriction. Before clinical symptoms become apparent, patients can present with asymptomatic structural or functional cardiac abnormalities (systolic or diastolic LV dysfunction) which are precursors of HF.\\nThe list of clinical syndromes for the differential diagnosis of heart \\nfailure based on left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) includes:\\n1. normal LVEF [typically considered as ≥50%; HF with preserved EF (HFpEF)] ;\\n\\n28\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE2. reduced LVEF [typically considered as <40%; HF with reduced EF \\n(HFrEF)];\\n3. mid-range LVEF [typically considered as 40–49% represent a ‘grey area’; HF with mid-range EF (HFmrEF)].\\n1. Patients with HFpEF do not have a dilated LV, increase in LV wall \\nthickness and/or increased left atrial (LA) size as a sign of increased filling pressures. Patients have an additional ‘evidence’ of impaired LV filling or suction capacity (diastolic dysfunction), which is generally considered as the likely cause of HF in these patients (hence the term ‘diastolic HF’).\\nDiastolic dysfunction is characterized by an inability of one or both \\nventricles to fill normally with blood. The mechanisms include: alterations in ventricular-arterial coupling, impaired hemodynamic response to exer-cise, elevated blood pressure during the episode of increased filling pres-sure. The findings are: obesity, lack of tachycardia, older age, normal radi-ographic heart size, normal LVEF, S4 (stiff ventricle). The causes include: hypertension, valvular (aortic stenosis), cardiomyopathy (restrictive, hyper-trophic), presence of the metabolic syndrome and pericardial disease. Other comorbidities associated in HFPEF include atrial fibrillation (AF), sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal dysfunction, alcohol, inherited, dyslipidemia, systemic inflammatory diseases, such as rheuma-toid arthritis, and certain medications, including antineoplastic agents, amiloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, hypo– or hyperthyroidism.\\n2. Patients with HFrEF  (previously referred to as ‘systolic HF’) also \\nhave diastolic dysfunction, and abnormalities of systolic function have been shown. Hence the preference for stating preserved or reduced LVEF over preserved or reduced ‘systolic function’. The mechanisms of systolic dys-\\nfunction include decreased contractility and increased afterload. In patients \\nwith systolic dysfunction, the heart is unable to contract normally, leading to exercise intolerance and decreased peripheral blood flow. The findings \\nare: dyspnea, previous infarction, edema and increased jugular venous pres-sure, and abnormal apical impulse (especially if sustained), tachycardia, decreased blood pressure or pulse pressure, S3, rales, radiograph (cardi-omegaly, redistribution), anterior Q waves, LBBB, LVEF <45% (dilated ventricle with volume overload). The causes include MI, cardiomyopathy (dilated, infiltrative), valvular (aortic stenosis, aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation), arterial hypertension and myocarditis.\\n3. Patients with HFmrEF have primarily mild systolic dysfunction with \\nfeatures of diastolic dysfunction. Compared with HFrEF, the patients with\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE29\\nHFpEF are older, more often women and more commonly have a history \\nof hypertension and atrial fibrillation (AF), with less common history of \\nmyocardial infarction. The characteristics of patients with HFmrEF are \\nbetween those with HFrEF and HFpEF.\\nLV diastolic dysfunction is thought to be the underlying pathophysi-\\nological abnormality in patients with HFpEF and perhaps HFmrEF, and \\nadditional extracardiac mechanisms, such as increased vascular stiffness, \\nimpaired renal function and others. \\nThe list of common pathophysiological causes for the differential \\ndiagnosis of chronic heart failure includes:\\n1. Impaired contractility– myocardial ischemia, coronary heart disease\\n– cardiomyopathies (e. g., dilatative, drug-induced)\\n– myocarditis\\n2. Cardiac arrhythmias– tachycardic arrhythmias\\n– bradycardic arrhythmias (e. g., AV block, sick sinus syndrome)\\n3. Pressure overload– arterial and pulmonary hypertension\\n– aortic stenosis\\n– pulmonic stenosis\\n4. Volume overload– mitral, tricuspid and aortic insufficiency\\n– pulmonary insufficiency\\n– shunt defects (atrial, ventricular)\\n– increased peripheral demand (high output failure)\\n5. Impaired filling– mitral and tricuspid stenosis\\n– tumors (e. g., atrial myxoma)\\n– pericardial tamponade, constrictive pericarditis\\n– hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\\n– restrictive cardiomyopathy (e. g., myocardial fibrosis, amyloidosis, sarcoidosis, Fabry disease)\\nThe list of clinical syndromes for the differential diagnosis of chronic \\nheart failure:\\n• Asymptomatic LV systolic dysfunction – the absence of the typical symptoms and/or signs of HF and with a reduced LVEF;\\n• Chronic HF – the presence of typical symptoms and signs of HF for \\nsome time;\\n\\n30\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE• Stable HF – unchanged symptoms and signs of HF for at least 1 \\nmonth;\\n• Decompensated chronic HF– deteriorated symptoms and signs of HF;\\n• Advanced HF – severe symptoms, recurrent decompensation and \\nsevere cardiac dysfunction;\\n• Left ventricular failure. Symptoms and signs of orthopnee, parox-\\nysmal, nocturnal dyspnoea, bilateral pulmonary rales, left– sided S3, wheezes, tachypnea;\\n• Right ventricular failure. Symptoms and signs of jugular vein \\nenlargement, right– sided S3, hepatomegaly, hepatojugular reflux, ascites, symptoms of intestinal congestion, bilateral peripheral edema;\\n• Hypoperfusion. Clinical symptoms and signs of hypoperfusion: \\nsweaty and cold extremities, oliguria, confusion, dizziness, dimin-ished peripheral pulse. Laboratory data: metabolic acidosis, increase serum levels of lactate and creatinine. Hypoperfusion is not synony-mous with hypotension, but its often associated with hypotension.\\nThe list of grades of severity for the differential diagnosis of chronic \\nheart failure (NYHA):\\n• FC I – no symptoms with ordinary physical activity;\\n• FC II – mild symptoms with normal activity (walking>2 blocks or 1 flight of stairs) ;\\n• FC III – symptoms with minimal exertion;\\n• FC IV – symptoms at rest.\\nThe list of stages based on structural changes and symptoms for the \\ndifferential diagnosis of chronic heart failure (ACCF/AHA):\\n• Stage A – At high risk for HF but without structural heart disease or symptoms of HF;\\n• Stage B – Structural heart disease but without signs or symptoms of HF;\\n• Stage C – Structural heart disease with prior or current symptoms of HF;\\n• Stage D – Refractory HF requiring specialized interventions.\\nA variety of heart diseases and mechanisms can lead to heart failure.The underlying cardiac causes are: diseased myocardium: coronary \\nartery disease (CAD), toxic damage, immune-mediated and inflamma-tory damage, infiltration, metabolic derangements, genetic abnormalities; abnormal loading conditions and arrhythmias.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE31\\nDiagnosis of chronic HF should first be evaluated based on the patient's \\nprior clinical history [CAD, arterial hypertension, diuretic use], presenting \\nsymptoms (e.g. dyspnoea, orthopnoea), physical examination (e.g. bilateral edema, increased jugular venous pressure, displaced apical beat) and resting electrocardiogram (ECG).\\xa0\\nNatriuretic peptide diagnosis. If at least one element is abnormal, \\nplasma natriuretic peptides (NPs) should be measured, to identify those who need echocardiography (an echocardiogram is indicated if the NP level is above the exclusion threshold or if circulating NP levels cannot be assessed). Elevated NPs help establish an initial working diagnosis, iden-tifying those who require further cardiac investigation; patients with val-ues below the cut-point for the exclusion of important cardiac dysfunction do not require echocardiography. In addition to heart failure, BNP is also \\nelevated with pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension, left ventri-cle hypertrophy, acute coronary syndrome, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, overload, and sepsis.\\nAn abnormal ECG suggests of the diagnosis of HF.\\xa0Some abnormali-\\nties on the ECG provide information on aetiology (e.g. myocardial infarc-tion, AF, pacing for bradycardia). HF is unlikely in patients presenting with a completely normal ECG.\\nTransthoracic echocardiography, that includes two-dimensional echo-\\ncardiography, pulsed and continuous wave Doppler, colour flow Doppler, tissue Doppler contrast echocardiography and deformation imaging (strain and strain rate) is the elected method for the assessment of myocardial systolic and diastolic function of both left and right ventricles. For the assessment of LV EF the modified biplane Simpson’s method is indicated. Pulsed and continuous wave Doppler, colour flow Doppler allow the esti-mation of haemodynamic data, based on the velocity time at the LV out-flow tract area. Tissue Doppler contrast echocardiography and deformation imaging (strain and strain rate) may detect abnormalities in the preclinical stage.\\nEchocardiographic data in patients with HFpEF/HFmrEF may be: a \\nleft atrial volume index (LAVI) >34 mL/m\\n2 or a left ventricular mass index \\n(LVMI) ≥115 g/m² for males and ≥95 g/m² for females. Key functional alterations are an E/e′ ≥13 and a mean e' septal and lateral wall <9 cm/s. Other (indirect) echocardiographically derived measurements are longitu-dinal strain or tricuspid regurgitation velocity (TRV).\\nA stress test or invasively measured elevated LV filling pressure – in\\n\\n32\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEcase of uncertainty. A diastolic stress test can be performed with echocar-\\ndiography, typically using a semi-supine bicycle ergometer exercise proto-col with assessment of LV (E/e′) and pulmonary artery pressures (TRV), systolic dysfunction (longitudinal strain), stroke volume and cardiac output changes with exercise. Different dynamic exercise protocols are available, with semi-supine bicycle ergometry and echocardiography at rest and sub-maximal exercise being used most often. Exercise-induced increases in E/e′ beyond diagnostic cut-offs (i.e. >13), and also other indirect measures of systolic and diastolic function, such as longitudinal strain or TRV, are used.\\nAlternatively, invasive haemodynamics at rest with assessment of fill-\\ning pressures [pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) ≥15 mmHg or left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP) ≥16 mmHg] followed by exercise haemodynamics if below these thresholds, with assessment of changes in filling pressures, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, stroke vol-ume and cardiac output, can be performed.\\nA chest X-ray is useful in identifying an alternative, pulmonary expla-\\nnation for a patient's symptoms and signs, i.e. pulmonary malignancy and interstitial pulmonary disease. For the diagnosis of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), pulmonary function testing with spirometry is needed. The chest X-ray may, however, show pulmonary venous congestion or edema in a patient with HF in the acute setting. It is important to note that significant LV dysfunction may be present without cardiomegaly on the chest X-ray.\\nCoronary angiography should be considered in patients with HF and \\nintermediate to high pre-test probability of CAD and the presence of ischae-mia in non-invasive stress tests in order to establish the ischaemic aetiology and CAD severity. Coronary angiography is recommended in patients with HF and angina pectoris recalcitrant to medical therapy, provided the patient is otherwise suitable for coronary revascularization. Coronary angiography is also recommended in patients with a history of symptomatic ventricular arrhyth-mia or aborted cardiac arrest. Coronary angiography should be considered in patients with HF and intermediate to high pre-test probability of CAD and the presence of ischaemia in non-invasive stress tests in order to establish the ischaemic aetiology and CAD severity.\\nCardiac computer tomography (CT) in patients with HF is as a \\nnon-invasive means to visualize the coronary anatomy in patients with HF with low intermediate pre-test probability of CAD or those with equivocal non-invasive stress tests in order to exclude the diagnosis of CAD.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE33\\nCardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) is acknowledged as the gold \\nstandard for the measurements of volumes, mass and EF of both the left \\nand right ventricles. It is the best alternative cardiac imaging modality for patients with non-diagnostic echocardiographic studies (particularly for imaging of the right heart) and is the method of choice in patients with complex congenital heart diseases.\\nSingle-photon emission computed tomography and radionuclide \\nventriculography (SPECT) may be useful in assessing ischaemia and myocardial viability. Gated SPECT can also yield information on ventricu-lar volumes and function, but exposes the patient to ionizing radiation. 3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (DPD) scintigraphy may be useful for the detection of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis.\\nPositron emission tomography (PET) (alone or with CT) may be \\nused to assess ischaemia and viability, but the flow tracers (N-13 ammonia or O-15 water) require an on-site cyclotron. Rubidium is an alternative tracer for ischaemia testing with PET, which can be produced locally at relatively low cost. Limited availability, radiation exposure and cost are the main limitations.\\nMolecular genetic analysis in patients with cardiomyopathies is rec-\\nommended when the prevalence of detectable mutations is sufficiently high and consistent to justify routine targeted genetic screening.\\nACUTE HEART FAILURE (AHF)\\nDefinition. AHF refers to rapid onset or worsening of symptoms and/\\nor signs of HF. It is a life– threatening medical condition requiring urgent evaluation and treatment, typically leading to urgent hospital admission.\\nAHF may present as a first occurrence (de novo) or, more frequently, as \\na consequence of acute decompensation of chronic HF, and may be caused by primary cardiac dysfunction or precipitated by extrinsic factors: acute myocardial dysfunction (ischaemic, inflammatory or toxic), acute valve insufficiency or pericardial tamponade are among the most frequent acute primary cardiac causes of AHF. Decompensation of chronic HF can occur without known precipitant factors, but more often with one or more fac-tors, such as infection, uncontrolled hypertension, rhythm disturbances or non-adherence with drugs/diet.\\nDiagnosis of AHF: history of assessing symptoms, prior cardiovascu-\\nlar history and potential cardiac and non-cardiac precipitants, as well as on the assessment of signs/symptoms of congestion and/or hypoperfusion\\n\\n34\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEby physic al examination and further confirmed by appropriate additional \\ninvestigations such as ECG (rapid atrial fibrillation, acute myocardial \\nischaemia), chest X-ray (pulmonary venous congestion, pleural effusion, \\ninterstitial or alveolar oedema and cardiomegaly), immediate echocardiog-raphy (mechanical complications, acute valvular regurgitation, aortic dissec-tion) and laboratory assessment with specific biomarkers. Laboratory tests \\nshould include: a plasma NP level (BNP , NT-proBNP), cardiac troponin, \\nblood urea nitrogen (BUN) (or urea), creatinine, electrolytes (sodium, \\npotassium), liver function tests, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), glu-cose and complete blood count; D-dimer is indicated in patients with a \\nsuspicion of acute pulmonary embolism. Arterial blood gas may be useful \\nwhen a precise measurement of O\\n2 and CO2 partial pressures is needed.\\nAcute heart failure may be caused by an acute pressure or volume over-\\nload on the systemic or pulmonary circulation, impaired cardiac filling, an acute decrease in myocardial contractility, or cardiac arrhythmias.\\nThe list of clinical syndromes for the differential diagnosis of acute \\nheart failure:\\n1. Acute decompensation of chronic heart failure;\\n2. Cardiogenic shock;\\n3. Acute coronary syndrome and heart failure;\\n4. Pulmonary edema;\\n5. Hypertensive AHF;\\n6. HF through increased cardiac output;\\n7. Right heart failure.\\n1. Acute decompensation of chronic heart failure. The common symp-\\ntoms and signs are: dyspnea, orthopnea, weight gain due to a volume over-\\nload and increased peripheral edema. The most frequent causes of cardiac decompensation are a new myocardial ischemia or arrhythmia, systemic infection, discontinuation of chronic medication, or adding medications \\nthat may cause decompensation due to fluid retention (e. g., non-steroid \\nanti-inflammatory drugs, steroids), use of medications that have a negative inotropic effect (calcium channel blockers or alcohol), refracterity to oral \\ntherapies, poorly controlled hypertension, anemia, hyperthyroidism. The \\nleading cause, myocardial ischemia or pulmonary embolism should first be confirmed or excluded by ECG and enzyme assays.\\nThe list of diseases for the differential diagnosis of acute decompensa-\\ntion of heart failure includes:\\nCardiac causes (see Chapters Differential diagnosis of Chest pain, Per-\\nicardial diseases, Cardiac arrhythmias):\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE35\\n• Myocardial (coronary artery disease, toxic damage, immune-me-\\ndiated and inflammatory damage, infiltration, metabolic derange-ments, genetic abnormalities);\\n• Pericardial (Cardiac tamponade);\\n• Arrhythmia;\\n• Valvular (aortic stenosis, acute aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgita-tion/stenosis, endocarditis).\\nB. Non-cardiac causes:Respiratory diseases (see Chapters Differential diagnosis of Bron-\\ncho-obstructive syndrome, Pulmonary consolidation, Diffuse interstitial pneumopathies, Allergic diseases):\\n• Airway– chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbation, asthma \\nexacerbation, acute bronchitis, bronchiectasis, foreign body obstruc-tion;\\n• Parenchymal: pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, interstitial lung disease exacerbation;\\n• Pleural: pneumothorax, pleural effusion;\\n• Vascular: pulmonary embolism, pulmonary hypertension.\\nSystemic: sepsis, metabolic acidosis, anemia, neuromuscular.Psychogenic: anxiety.2. Cardiogenic shock is defined as the evidence of inadequate tissue \\nperfusion, after appropriate correction of preloud and severe rhythm disor-ders. Signs of tissue hypoperfusion and pulmonary congestion are rapidly developing. Cardiogenic shock is usually characterized by low blood pres-sure (SBP < 90 mm Hg or a decrease in mean blood pressure > 30 mm\\xa0Hg) and/or low urinary flow rate (<0.5 ml/kg/h). The development of cardio-genic shock is associated with evidences of sympathetic nervous system \\nactivation with peripheral vasoconstriction (cold extremities) and signs of inadequate organ perfusion, reduced blood pressure, tachycardia, oliguria, anuria, coma, metabolic acidosis and urine output less than 20 mL/hour.\\nThe list of diseases for the differential diagnosis of cardiogenic shock \\nincludes:\\nCardiac causes (see Differential diagnosis of chest pain, Differential \\ndiagnosis of pericardial diseases, Differential diagnosis of non-ischemic cardiomyopathies):\\n• Acute coronary syndrome;\\n• Valvular insufficiencies;\\n• Dilated cardiomyopathy;\\n\\n36\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE• Restrictive cardiomyopathy;\\n• Pericarditis and cardiac tamponade;\\n• Papillary muscle rupture;\\n• Acute valvular dysfunction.\\nNon-cardiac causes (see Differential diagnosis of pulmonary consoli-\\ndation):\\n• Systemic inflammatory response syndrome\\n• Hypovolemic shock\\n• Septic shock\\nLess frequent causes of circulatory shock are (see Differential diagno-\\nsis of allergic diseases):\\n• anaphylaxis\\n• drug overdose\\n• Addison crisis\\n• myxedema.\\n3. Acute coronary syndrome and heart failure. The most frequent \\ncause of cardiogenic shock is ACS with left ventricular pump failure that \\ncomplicates approximately 5% of all myocardial infarctions. Approxi-mately 1-3% of acute MIs are associated with ventricular septal rupture. Most septal ruptures occur within the week following MI. Patients with left ventricular pump failure or papillary muscle rupture present initially with holosystolic murmur and left parasternal thrill, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, tachycardia and hypotension. Patients with a predominantly right ventricular infarction or ruptured ventricular septum present initially with signs of low cardiac output and right-sided heart failure. Doppler ECG findings: a left-to-right intracardiac shunt.\\nValvular insufficiencies are the most common diseases leading to car-\\ndiogenic shock. Severe mitral insufficiency may result from a partial or complete chordae tendineae rupture due to a myxomatous mitral valve or infectious endocarditis. Acute aortic insufficiency may develop as a conse-quence of endocarditis or an aortic dissection. In patients with a prosthetic heart valve, valvular dysfunction is assumed to be the cause of cardiogenic shock until proven otherwise. The decompensation of severe aortic stenosis or mitral stenosis or the mechanical obstruction of ventricular filling by an atrial myxoma are other potential causes of cardiogenic shock.\\nNon-cardiogenic shockSystemic inflammatory response syndrome is a clinical response to \\nischemia, inflammation, trauma and infection. The common symptoms and\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE37\\nsigns are: fever of more than 38°C or less than 36°C (96.8°F), heart rate of \\nmore than 90 beats per minute, respiratory rate of more than 20 breaths per minute or arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO \\n2) of less than 32 mm Hg \\nand abnormal white blood cell count (>12,000/µL or <4,000/µL or >10% immature forms).\\nHypovolemic shock following the trauma, burns, bone fractures, and \\ncopious diarrhea or vomiting is generally easy to recognize, based on the associated conditions. If hypovolemic shock is suspected but there are no external signs of bleeding, the patient should be examined for intestinal bleeding or other internal hemorrhage.\\nSeptic shock is most commonly caused by infection with Gram-nega-\\ntive bacteria. The examination often reveals a warm periphery, hematologic signs of infection, and metabolic acidosis, suggesting the correct diagnosis.\\nIt is important to consider that the pumping ability of the heart may be \\nimpaired to some degree, even in noncardiogenic shock. This is probably due to the release of cytokines (such as TNF-α), NO or endotoxins.\\n4. Pulmonary edema is a life-threatening event in patients with left \\nventricular heart failure. Pulmonary edema develops when fluid extravasa-tion outstrips the reabsorption by the capillaries and exceeds the drainage capacity of the lymphatics. The rate of fluid reabsorption is determined by the intravascular and interstitial oncotic pressure. The normal pulmo-nary capillary pressure is 8-12 mmHg, and the normal oncotic pressure of the plasma is approximately 25 mmHg. This pressure differential ensures the complete reabsorption of the fluid. When the hydrostatic intravascular (pulmonary capillary) pressure rises and approaches 18-25 mmHg, inter-stitial edema occurs initially, and alveolar edema develops at higher pres-sures. Pulmonary edema may also result from the damage to the alveolar capillary membrane or from a fall in the oncotic pressure. Insufficient lym-phatic drainage is rarely a cause of pulmonary edema. The typical symp-toms are the development of very severe dyspnea and a cough productive of frothy white, pink, or blood tinged sputum. Other common features are cold sweats, pallor, and cyanosis. Auscultation of the chest reveals coarse, moist bubbling rales and wheezing. The lung sounds make cardiac auscul-tation difficult, but it may be possible to hear the third heart sound and a prominent second heart sound (increased pulmonic component).\\nLaboratory tests can provide the evidence of an infection, electrolyte \\ndisorders, possible renal failure, and hypoproteinemia. A blood gas anal-\\nysis is important in assessing the extent of hypoxemia. Echocardiography\\n\\n38\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEand right heart catheterization will usually make it possible to confirm or \\nexclude a cardiac cause of pulmonary edema. Right heart catheterization, \\nusually with a Swan-Ganz balloon-tipped catheter, can measure the pul-monary capillary wedge pressure in order to determine whether the edema stems from an elevated pulmonary venous pressure, which would most likely indicate a cardiac cause. Oximetry and pressure measurements in all \\ncardiac chambers also make it possible to detect a specific cardiac cause.\\nThe list of diseases for the differential diagnosis of pulmonary edema \\nincludes:\\n• Acute mitral regurgitation\\n• Noncardiogenic pulmonary edema\\n• High-altitude pulmonary edema\\n• Neurogenic pulmonary edema\\n• Preeclampsia or eclampsia\\n• Heroin overdose\\n• General anesthesia\\nAcute mitral regurgitation is associated with inferior myocardial \\ninfarction of the papillary muscle and posteromedial papillary muscle is involved more frequently than anterolateral muscle. It is recognized by holosystolic regurgitant murmur of mitral insufficiency. The murmur may be absent if papillary muscle rupture has occurred, creating a condition known as „silent mitral insufficiency.” Acute mitral insufficiency usually happens 2-7 days after acute myocardial infarction. Echocardiography findings shows the malfunctioning mitral valve, and Doppler study – the severity of mitral regurgitation.\\nNon-cardiac pulmonary edema is caused by a number of viral, bacte-\\nrial, and parasitic infections. Infectious lung edema is usually preceded by \\nfever, cough, malaise, and gastrointestinal symptoms. The clinical features are similar to those with cardiogenic pulmonary edema, but there is no jug-ular venous distention an S\\n3 gallop. Chest radiograph shows the infiltrates \\nof more peripheral than perihilar distribution. Oximetry: large intrapul-monary shunt volume. Natriuretic peptide is negative. Pulmonary capillary wedge pressure is less than 18 mm Hg.\\nHigh-altitude pulmonary edema occurs in otherwise healthy, usually \\nyoung individuals who ascend rapidly to an altitude of more than 2500 m and then engage in strenuous physical activity. The hypoxia-induced rise in pulmonary arterial pressures is an important pathogenic factor and genetic predisposition and immunological factors must play a role.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE39\\nNeurogenic pulmonary edema occurs in a number of cerebral disor-\\nders (epilepsy, trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage). It is assumed that cen-\\ntral stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system causes a redistribution of blood flow from the systemic to the pulmonary circulation, leading sec-ondarily to a rise in the pulmonary capillary pressure.\\nPulmonary edema in a setting of preeclampsia or eclampsia is found \\nin approximately 3% of eclampsia women. It is more common in older multiparous women with preexisting hypertension.\\nPulmonary edema after a heroin overdose is a result of membrane \\ninjury. Other narcotics that may cause pulmonary edema are methadone, morphine, cocaine, and dextropropoxyphene.\\nPulmonary edema after general anesthesia may be a side effect of the \\nanesthetic agents, but is more likely due to other causes such as laryngo-spasm, hypoxia, or a hyperadrenergic state.\\n5. Hypertensive AHF: Signs and symptoms of AHF are accompanied \\nby high blood pressure and preserved LV function in the presence of signs of increased sympathetic tone tachycardia and vasoconstriction.\\n6. HF through increased cardiac output usually develops with increased \\nheart rate (in arrhythmias, thyrotoxicosis, anemia, Paget's disease, iatroge-neous or other mechanisms), with warm periphery, pulmonary congestion, and changes in blood pressure.\\n7. Right heart failure is characterized by low cardiac output syndrome, \\nincreased jugular vein pressure, hepatomegaly, hypotension and lack of lung congestion, abdominal syndrome with nausea, vomiting, right-sided abdominal pain (as a sign of liver congestion), bloating, anorexia, and significant weight loss. In advanced cases, patients can appear jaundiced because of cardiac cirrhosis. Constipation is a common complaint among patients with heart failure, and it can be a manifestation of decreased intes-tinal transit secondary to poor perfusion.\\nThe list of diseases for the differential diagnosis of right heart fail-\\nure includes the following causes (see Chapters Differential diagnosis of \\nHepatomegaly, Nephrotic syndrome, Pericardial diseases, Non-ischemic cardiomyopathies):\\n• Liver cirrhosis\\n• Nephrotic syndrome\\n• Pericardial disease\\n• Right ventricular infarction\\n• Pulmonary hypertension\\n\\n40\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE• Myocarditis\\n• Non-ischemic cardiomyopathies\\nLiver cirrhosis: causes jaundice, fatigue, nausea, peripheral oedema, \\nascites, bruising and prolonged bleeding, gynaecomastia, and haemateme-\\nsis. Liver functional tests are abnormal. Ultrasound may detect ascites and liver abnormalities. Liver biopsy shows characteristic cirrhotic changes and \\nmay reveal the underlying cause.\\nNephrotic syndrome: typically causes peripheral oedema, fatigue, dysp-\\nnoea, and loss of appetite. Urinalysis shows proteinuria: >3.5 g protein in \\ntwenty-four-hour urine collection and serum albumin is reduced. Serum \\nurea and creatinine clearance may be abnormal in later stages. Serum cho-\\nlesterol and triglyceride levels may be raised. Kidney ultrasound and biopsy may reveal the underlying cause.\\nPericardial disease: may present with chest pain, typically worse on \\nlying down, swallowing or coughing, tachycardia, dyspnoea, cough, oedema, fatigue, and low-grade fever. Pericardial friction rub may be heard at the left sternal border or apex. ECG may show electrical alternans or ST ele-\\nvation and T wave flattening or inversion. Echocardiography may detect \\npericardial effusion, tamponade, and pericardial fibrosis. CT scan or MRI may show thickened pericardium.\\nRight ventricular infarction. The diagnosis is made by identifying an \\nST-segment elevation in the right precordial leads (V\\n3 or V4 R) and/or \\ntypical hemodynamic findings after right heart catheterization. These are elevated right atrial and right ventricular end-diastolic pressures with nor-\\nmal to low pulmonary artery wedge pressure and low cardiac output.\\nPulmonary hypertension. The causes of lung small arteries obstruction \\nare: left heart disease, heriditary, heamatological, lung disease, connective tissue and metabolic disease, drug-related, HIV infection and pulmonary \\ncapillary haemangiomatosis. The main symptoms include: chest pain, dysp-nea, syncope. The clinical signs are: left parasternal lift, accentuated pul-monary component of second heart sound, systolic murmur of tricuspid \\nregurgitation, diastolic murmur of pulmonary insufficiency, hepatomeg-\\naly, ascites and peripheral edema. ECG findings: right heart (atrium and ventricular) dilatation, T wave negative in the V1-V3 leads. Chest radiog-raphy data: enlarged right hilum, decrease in retrosternal air space, indi-\\ncating right ventricular cardiomegaly. Echocardiography: right ventricular \\nhypertrophy, right atria and ventricular dilatation, interventricular septal \\nflattening, or a D-shaped LV. Right heart catheterisation: increase in mean pulmonary arterial pressure > 25 mmHg at rest.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE41\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\n1. Braunwald's Heart Disease.

The prevalence of hypertension in different \\ncountries appears to be around 30–45% of the general population, with a \\nsteep increase with ageing. There also appear to be noticeable differences in the average BP levels across countries, with no systematic trends towards BP changes in the past decade.\\nDEFINITION. According to 2017 ACC /AHA /AAPA /ABC /\\nACPM /AGS /APhA /ASH/ASPC/NMA/PCNA Guideline for the Pre-vention, Detection, Evaluation, and Management of High Blood Pressure \\nin Adults, arterial hypertension is defined as values ≥130 mmHg systolic blood pressure (SBP) and/or ≥ 80 mmHg diastolic blood pressure (DBP), based on the evidence from Randomized Controlled Trials that in patients with these BP values treatment-induced BP reductions are beneficial.\\nCLASSIFICATION of office BP levels (mmHg):1. Normal SBP/ DBP <120/< 80 mmHg\\n2. Elevated SBP/ DBP 120-129 /< 80mmHg\\n3. Hypertension Stage 1 – SBP/ DBP 130-139 / 80-89mmHg\\n4. Hypertension Stage 2 – SBP/ DBP ≥140/≥90mmHg.\\nCategories of BP in adults• „White coat” hypertension – the presence of elevated BP (≥135/85 mmHg) levels at medical institutions (as a conditional response to the unusual situation), but normal BP levels during self-measure-ments,\\n• ‘White-coat-’or ‘isolated office-’ or ‘isolated clinic hypertension’ – the presence of elevated BP in the office at repeated visits and normal out of the office,\\n• ‘Masked-’ or ‘isolated ambulatory hypertension’– the presence of normal BP in the office and abnormally high (BP (≥130/80 mmHg) out of the medical environment.\\nClassification of arterial hypertension by aetiology:I. PRIMARY OR ESSENTIAL HYPERTENSION refers to hyper-\\ntension without demonstrable cause. It accounts for 95% of all cases of hypertension and is a diagnosis of exclusion.\\nII. SECONDARY HYPERTENSION has a clearly determined \\npathophysiology.\\n\\n44\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEI. PRIMARY (ESSENTIAL) HYPERTENSION\\nPathophysiology. Primary hypertension is present in more than 90 % \\nof patients with hypertension. The underlying pathology is unknown. There \\nare, however, several hereditary forms of hypertension (e.g., cellular ion channel defects) and acquired forms (e.g., obesity and high sodium intake) that contribute, at least in part, to the development of hypertension.\\nDiagnosis of hypertension. Primary analysis that includes recognition \\nof secondary forms of hypertension and risk assessment is recommended for patients with confirmed elevated blood pressure levels, either by repet-itive measurements at primary care facilities or during ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.\\nMost patients with primary hypertension have no symptoms. Some \\npatients complain of unspecific symptoms, such as headache, dizziness, impaired vision, or dyspnea.\\nThe symptoms and signs of organ damage include:– cerebrovascular system: transient ischemic attack, ischemic stroke, hemorrhagic stroke; motor or sensory defects;\\n– retina: funduloscopic abnormalities;\\n– heart: angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, congestive heart fail-ure; 3rd or 4th heart sound, heart murmurs, arrhythmias, location of apical impulse, pulmonary rales, peripheral oedema;\\n– kidneys: nephrosclerosis with proteinuria and renal failure;\\n– peripheral vasculature: atherosclerotic stenosis and occlusion, absence, reduction, or asymmetry of pulses, cold extremities, ischemic skin lesions;\\n– carotid arteries: systolic murmurs;\\n– evidence of obesity (BMI≥30).\\nRisk assessment is essential for the evaluation of indication for treat-\\nment and treatment goals. The recommendations on prevention of coro-\\nnary heart disease (CHD) in clinical practice should be related to quanti-fication of total cardiovascular (CV) risk. The concept is based on the fact that only a small fraction of the hypertensive population has an elevation of BP alone, with the majority exhibiting additional CV risk factors. When concomitantly present, and other CV risk factors may potentiate each other, leading to a total CV risk that is greater than the sum of its indi-vidual components. Although the relative risk of incident CVD associated \\nwith higher SBP and DBP is smaller at older ages, the corresponding high\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE45\\nBP–related increase in absolute risk is larger in older persons (≥65 years) \\ngiven the higher absolute risk of CVD at an older age.\\nII. SECONDARY HYPERTENSION\\nThe rate of secondary forms of hypertension ranges between 4 and 8% \\nin different patient populations (primary care, secondary care clinics or specialized cardiovascular centers).\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF SECONDARY HYPER-\\nTENSION includes:\\n1. renal disease,\\n2. endocrine,\\n3. cardiovascular,\\n4. neurogenic,\\n5. pregnancy,\\n6. toxic agent-induced and drug-induced hypertension\\n7. obstructive sleep apnea.\\nThe list of causes of renal hypertension includes:– acute and chronic glomerulonephritis;\\n– chronic interstitial nephritis;\\n– cystic kidney disease;\\n– diabetic nephropathy;\\n– collagen-vascular disorders;\\n– congenital hypoplasia;\\n– vesicoureteral reflux;\\n– unilateral hydronephrosis;\\n– postradiation nephritis;\\n– renovascular disease (unilateral or bilateral);\\n– atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis;\\n– fibromuscular dysplasia;\\n– renin-producing tumor;\\n– kidney transplantation.\\nThe list of causes of endocrine hypertension includes:– mineralocorticoid hypertension;\\n– Cushing syndrome;\\n– pheochromocytoma;\\n– hyperthyroidism;\\n– hypothyroidism;\\n– primary hyperparathyroidism;\\n\\n46\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE– acromegaly;\\n– neuroendocrine tumor (carcinoid).\\nThe list of causes of cardiovascular hypertension includes:\\n– aortic sclerosis;\\n– coarctation of the aorta;\\n– aortic regurgitation;\\n– complete atrioventricular block.\\nThe list of causes of neurogenic hypertension includes:– increased intracranial pressure;\\n– sleep apnea syndrome;\\n– acute porphyria;\\n– lead intoxication.\\nThe list of categories of hypertension in pregnancy includes:– chronic hypertension;\\n– preeclampsia-eclampsia;\\n– preeclampsia superimposed on chronic hypertension;\\n– gestational hypertension.\\nThe list of toxic agent-induced and drug-induced hypertension \\nincludes:\\n– contraceptives;\\n– nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs;\\n– sympathicomimetics;\\n– erythropoietin;\\n– cyclosporine;\\n– alcohol;\\n– amphetamine;\\n– cocaine;\\n– anabolic steroids.\\nDiagnosis. Secondary hypertension forms can be suspected or diag-\\nnosed by accurate evaluation of the history, clinical examination, and rou-tine laboratory tests.\\nThe medical history should include the information about the family \\nhistory of:\\n– kidney disease CKD (polycystic kidney);\\n– urinary tract infection, haematuria;\\n– analgesic abuse (parenchymal renal disease);\\n– drug/substance intake, e.g. gluco– and mineralocorticosteroids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, oral contraceptives, liquo-\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE47\\nrice, carbenoxolone, vasoconstrictive nasal drops, cocaine, ampheta-\\nmines, erythropoietin, cyclosporine;\\n– repetitive episodes of sweating, headache, anxiety, palpitations (phe-ochromocytoma);\\n– episodes of muscle weakness and tetany (hyperaldosteronism);\\n– symptoms suggestive of thyroid disease;\\n– snoring, sleep apnoea (information also from partner).\\nSigns suggesting secondary hypertension– Features of Cushing syndrome;\\n– Skin stigmata of neurofibromatosis (pheochromocytoma);\\n– Palpation of enlarged kidneys (polycystic kidney);\\n– Auscultation of abdominal murmurs (renovascular hypertension);\\n– Auscultation of precordial or chest murmurs (aortic coarctation, aor-tic disease, upper extremity artery disease);\\n– Diminished and delayed femoral pulses and reduced femoral blood pressure compared to simultaneous arm BP (aortic coarctation, aor-tic disease, lower extremity artery disease);\\n– Left–right arm BP difference (aortic coarctation, subclavian artery stenosis).\\nLaboratory tests should include:\\nRoutine tests:– Haemoglobin and haematocrit;\\n– Fasting plasma glucose;\\n– Serum total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, fasting serum triglycerides;\\n– Serum potassium and sodium;\\n– Serum uric acid;\\n– Serum creatinine (with estimation of glomerular filtration rate -GFR) ;\\n– Urine analysis: microscopic examination, urinary protein by dipstick test;\\n– 12-lead ECG.\\nAdditional tests:– Haemoglobin A1c [(if fasting plasma glucose is >5.6 mmol/L (102 mg/dL) or previous diagnosis of diabetes];\\n– Quantitative proteinuria (if dipstick test is positive);\\n– Urinary potassium and sodium concentration and their ratio;\\n– Home and 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring;\\n\\n48\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE– Echocardiogram;\\n– Holter monitoring in case of arrhythmias;\\n– Exercise testing;\\n– Carotid ultrasound;\\n– Peripheral artery/abdominal ultrasound;\\n– Pulse wave velocity;\\n– Ankle-brachial index;\\n– Fundoscopy.\\n1. Renal hypertension\\nRenal parenchymal disease accounts for approximately 5% of hyper-\\ntension cases.\\nThe most common causes of secondary renal parenchymal hypertension \\nare:\\n– Acute and chronic glomerulonephritis,\\n– Chronic interstitial nephritis,\\n– Cystic kidney disease,\\n– Diabetic nephropathy\\n– Polycystic kidney disease.\\nDiagnosis. Physical examination may reveal: abdominal masses (in \\ncase of polycystic kidney disease), oedema, or change in urine output. Laboratory investigations denote: the presence of protein, erythrocytes, or leucocytes in the urine, decreased glomerular filtration rate, high serum creatinine, chronic anaemia, abnormal urine analysis. First-line test: renal ultrasound may identify sclerotic or polycystic kidneys.\\nRenovascular hypertension is the most common, curable form but it \\naccounts for less than 1% of hypertension cases.\\nThe most common causes of secondary renovascular hypertension are:– atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis,\\n– fibromuscular dysplasia.\\nThe rare causes include:– renal artery embolism,\\n– renal artery aneurysm,\\n– arteriovenous fistula,\\n– arteriitis,\\n– coarctation of the abdominal aorta,\\n– neurofibromatosis.\\nHemodynamically significant stenosis is defined as a 70% diameter nar-\\nrowing of the renal artery that results in significant reduction of renal blood\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE49\\nflow (70%), decreased intraglomerular pressure, activation of the renin-an-\\ngiotensin system to increase BP , and decreased kidney size. Increases in plasma AII levels result in vasoconstriction and increase BP . A key role for angiotensin II (AII) is to maintain perfusion pressure within the intraglomerula through constriction of efferent arterioles and increases in systemic BP . Increases in intrarenal AII also cause transient sodium reten-tion, through AII effects on proximal tubules, which culminates in pres-sure natriuresis secondary to increases in BP over time and reestablishes sodium balance. When stenosis is bilateral, the mechanism of hypertension is through volume expansion. Renal artery stenosis is often located at the origin of the renal artery from the abdominal aorta and in the proximal part of the artery.\\nSeveral findings from the medical history and clinical examination may \\nraise the suspicion of renal artery stenosis: abdominal bruit may be present, acute or subacute onset of hypertension.\\nAtherosclerotic renal artery stenosis is more common in males and \\ncoincides with lesions of the aorta and iliac arteries. It is associated with hypertension of abrupt onset, worsening or increasingly difficult to treat.\\nFibromuscular dysplasia is more common in younger women with early \\nonset hypertension. The right renal artery is involved more often than the left renal artery, and typical lesions are found in the middle and distal parts of the renal artery. Angiographically, the „beaded string” sign helps to make the diagnosis. The typical angiographic appearance reflects dysplasia and proliferation of the fibromuscular components of the media. Discrete fibro-muscular stenosis or long and smooth lesions are less common. Fibromus-cular dysplasia is seen not only in the renal arteries but similarly in the carotid, mesenteric, or iliac arteries.\\nOn renal duplex ultrasound or magnetic resonance angiogram of renal \\narteries the difference of >1.5 cm in length between the two kidneys con-firms the diagnosis. Color-coded Doppler ultrasound allows both localiza-tion and exact hemodynamic determination of the degree of stenosis. Mul-tislice computed tomography angiography permits imaging of the renal arteries by means of intravenous injection of iodine contrast material and has a low interobserver variability. Magnetic resonance angiography is the imaging modality of choice for patients with severe renal failure because it requires no iodine contrast dye. Conventional angiography remains the „gold standard” for diagnosing or excluding renal artery stenosis.\\n\\n50\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE2. Endocrine hypertension\\nPrimary aldosteronism (Conn syndrome) prevalence varies from 1% \\nto 11%, increases according to hypertension severity, and cross-sectional \\nand prospective studies report primary aldosteronism in 10% of patients with hypertension, with approximately 70% caused by adrenal adeno\\n-\\nmas. The adenoma is usually unilateral and comprised of glomerulosa \\ncells in the adrenal cortex. Rarely, primary aldosteronism is caused by adre-nal carcinoma or hyperplasia. Adrenal hyperplasia is more prevalent among older men, and both adrenals are overactive without adenoma. The symp-toms and signs: muscle weakness, family history of early onset hyperten-sion and cerebrovascular events at old age, arrhythmias (in case of severe hypokalemia). Diagnosis is suspected in patients with hypertension with unprovoked hypokalemia confirmed by elevated plasma aldosterone levels and low plasma renin activity, aldosterone–renin ratio under standardized conditions (correction of hypokalemia and withdrawal of drugs affecting RAA system). Nuclear imaging of the adrenal glands is another option to localize excessive aldosterone production.\\nPheochromocytoma. Approximately 15% of pheochromocytoma cases \\nare familial, often they are bilateral, at multiple sites, and 10% of cases are malignant. Pheochromocytomas produce catecholamines and are usu-ally localized in the adrenal medulla. In addition, catecholamine-produc-ing tumors may origin from extra-adrenal chromaffin cells (paraganglio-mas), e. g., from the glomus caroticum, and in postganglionic sympathetic neurons (ganglioneuromas). On physical examination: skin stigmata of neurofibromatosis, blood pressure values may be continuously elevated. In one-third of the patients, typical paroxysmal hypertension or a crisis superimposed to sustained hypertension may occur. Typical symptoms include headaches, sweating, palpitations and pallor, positive family his-tory of pheochromocytoma. In severe forms, proteinuria, retinopathy, or encephalopathy may occur. In addition, tremor, chest or abdominal pain, vomitus can accompany the crisis. Angina pectoris with or without ECG changes, myocardial infarction, pulmonary edema, or seizures may occur. Screening is performed by measuring urinary fractionated metanephrines or plasma-free metanephrines, incidental discovery of adrenal (or in some cases, extra-adrenal) masses. Imaging tests are required to localize the site of hormone production. Ultrasound may be used because tumors are often large. CT, however, is the routine imaging modality. MR imaging is advan-tageous because it helps in the differential diagnosis of adrenal tumors.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE51\\nNuclear imaging is helpful for identifying extra-adrenal tumors or metas-\\ntases. MR imaging is helpful in excluding pheochromocytoma in patients with adenoma on CT scan.\\nCushing syndrome. The cause of the Cushing syndrome or hypercor-\\ntisolism is excessive adrenal production of glucocorticosteroids. Systemic arterial hypertension is found in 80% of patients with the endogenous Cushing syndrome. Excessive corticosteroid production may be due to increased pituitary or ectopic production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), or due to ACTH-independent, adrenal cortisol production. Classic symptoms and signs include rapid weight gain, polyuria, polydipsia, psychological disturbances, moon face, dorsicocervical fat pad, abdominal striae, and easy bruisability. In patients with typical symptoms, the diag-nosis is confirmed by the measurement of substantially elevated levels of cortisol from 24-hour urine samples. Screening for endogenous hypercor-tisolism is especially useful in patients with typical signs, including typi-cal redistribution of subcutaneous tissue, obvious padding in temporal and subclavicular depressions, as well as nuchally, skin atrophy, or muscle weak-ness. The measurement of free cortisol from a 24-hour urine sample is the „gold standard” for the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. Screening may also be performed using dexamethasone suppression, which includes intake of 1 mg of dexamethasone at midnight and measurement of the serum cortisol level at 08:00 the next morning. In outpatients late-night salivary cortisol can be assessed at midnight. At midnight, cortisol levels are low in healthy, unstressed individuals.\\nAcromegaly is caused by excessive production of growth hormone in \\nadults and is associated with hypertension in half of cases. Hypertension is more common among the elderly in whom small, slow-growing tumors are found. It is less common in younger patients who usually have devel-oped symptoms more recently, and tumors often are large and fastgrowing. Psychosocial factors, such as stress or depression, may have an unfavorable effect on the cardiovascular system through increased release of catechola-mines or glucocorticoids. The main signs are: acral enlargement in the face (supraorbital bulging, nose, chin), hands (digits, rings do not fit), and feet (increase in shoe size), subcutaneous swelling, visceromegaly, macroglos-sia, skin thickening, hyperhidrosis, arthropathy, neuropathy, carpal tunnel syndrome, snoring, sleep apnea, insulin resistance, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia (diabetes mellitus), cardiomegaly and cardiomyopathy (often associated with hypertension). The diagnosis is confirmed by ele-\\n\\n52\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEvated levels of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1. Growth \\nhormone levels after oral glucose tolerance testing are used to confirm the diagnosis. If the clinical diagnosis of acromegaly is confirmed by laboratory testing, MRI reveals pituitary adenoma in most cases. In rare circumstances, acromegaly is caused by excessive hypothalamic or pancreatic production of growth hormone releasing factor.\\n3. Cardiovascular HypertensionThe common causes of cardiovascular hypertension include:– aortic atherosclerosis;\\n– coarctation of the aorta.\\nAortic atherosclerosis. Systolic hypertension of the elderly has cardio-\\nvascular origin. The aorta receives the pressure wave and the bolus of blood with less resilience, hence the systolic rise found in the brachial artery. This was thought to be a condition of aging that caused no damage; more recent studies have found an association with strokes and other hyperten-sive complications. Isolated systolic hypertension is also associated with an \\nincreased risk of cardiovascular events.\\nAortic coarctation is a congenital, cardiovascular malformation and is \\nclassified depending on the localization of stenosis in relation to the ductus arteriosus: preductal form in infants and postductal form in adults. Hyper-\\ntension is present in vascular regions that are localized proximally to the coarctation, and hypotension is present distally to the coarctation. Elevated blood pressure values (using an upper arm cuff ) are found on the right arm if the origin of the left subclavian artery is involved in the coarctation. The clinical examination reveals the radial to femoral pulse delay, on bilateral pulse palpation, absent femoral pulses, and on auscultation: systolic or sys-tolo-diastolic murmur that is interscapular and often left of the thoracic spinal column. The following imaging modalities are useful: chest radio-graph: costal notching due to the presence of collaterals; occasional notch-ing of the descending aorta and ECG: left ventricle hypertrophy, echocar-diography, three-dimensional MR angiography.\\nAortic regurgitation and complete atrioventricular block can cause \\nincreased cardiac output and hypertension. The diagnosis can be estab-lished clinically using the clinical examination, electrocardiogram, and echocardiography.\\n4.

Simple mechanical neck pain describes a common, usually self-limiting, clinical presentation of pain with or without restricted \\nmovement, but without neurological or „red ﬂag” features. The onset may \\nbe acute (acute torticollis, or „wry neck”) or gradual, and, like low back pain, tends to be recurrent. It usually responds to conservative treatment, although patients should be instructed to return for further assessment if symptoms persist or change in quality. Neck pain may be accompanied by \\nmyofascial or diffuse regional pain often involving the shoulder girdle, on \\npalpation of trigger points („knots” within muscle).\\nTable 22\\nCauses of cervical pain\\nMalformations Arnold-Chiari malformation\\nAthlantoaxoid malformation\\nDevelopmental anomalies Klippel-Feil syndrome,Vertebra in block,Cervical rib\\nCongenital diseases Hunter syndromeHurler syndromeMorquio syndromeDown syndromeOther congenital diseases\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE345\\nChanges in cervical curvature Congenital or acquired torticollis \\nInflammatory diseases Ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, \\njuvenile chronic arthritis, adult Still disease, psoriatic arthritis \\nInfections Spondylodiscitis (brucella, tuberculosis, other bacteria’s)\\nDegenerative diseases Cervical osteoarthritis, Forestier and Rotes-Querol disease\\nDiscopathies Herniated disc\\nTrauma Vertebral fractures, Vertebral whiplash syn-drome\\nTumors Primary, metastatic\\nMetabolic diseases Osteoporosis, Paget disease, alcaptonuria (ochronosis), Acromegaly\\nNonvertebral cervicalgia’s (re-ferred pain)Cardiovascular diseases, rheumatic diseases, neurological diseases, others\\nSoft tissue disease Fibromyalgia, postural cervicalgia, myofascial syndrome, tension headache\\nOthers Spinal canal stenosis\\nPsychogenic origin\\nRadicular cervical pain due to compression of a nerve root from her-\\nniation of a cervical disc, or due to non– compressive causes such as local \\ninfection or tumour, refers to neck pain that radiates into the shoulder gir-dle and/or arm with paraesthesia or numbness in a root distribution (Table 23). Subjective weakness is less common. Examination may not reveal the nerve root level because of the extensive overlap of dermatomes. Motor involvement and/or objective sensory loss warrant urgent referral for spe-cialist assessment. About 40 – 80% of people with compressive cervical radiculopathy have complete resolution of their symptoms over time with conservative treatment.\\nAn important clue is that lumbar disc protrusion tends to compress the \\nnerve root that exits one vertebral level below the protrusion.\\nCervical myelopathy (compression of the spinal cord), which may \\narise due to midline disc herniation, is suggested by a history of difﬁculty walking, lower limb symptoms or bladder and bowel dysfunction. Motor signs of myelopathy below the level of spinal cord involvement may include weakness with increased reﬂexes and tone (upper motor neurone signs), decreased pinprick sensation and loss of position and/or vibration sense.Table 22 (cont.)\\n\\n346\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINETable 23\\nDisc herniation: cervical and lumbar radiculopathy\\nDisc Root Pain/ Paresthesia Sensory loss Motor loss  Reflex Loss\\nC4–C5 C5 Neck, shoulder, \\nupper armShoulder Deltoid, biceps infra-spinatusBiceps\\nC5–C6 C6 Neck, shoulder, \\nlateral, arms, radi-al forearm, thumb \\nand index fingerLateral arms, \\nradial fore-arm,thumb and \\nindex fingerBiceps brachio– \\nradialisBiceps, bra-chioradialis supinator\\nC6–C7 C7 Neck, lateral arm, ring and index fingersRadial forearm index and middle fingersTriceps, extensor carpi ulnaris Triceps su-pinator\\nC7–T1 C8 Ulnar forearm and handUlnar half of ring finger, little fingerIntrinsic hand muscles, wrist extensors, flexor dig profundusFinger flex-ion\\nL3–L4 L4 Anterior thigh, inner shinAnteromedial thigh and shin, inner footQuadriceps Patella\\nL4–L5 L5 Lateral thigh and calf dorsum of foot, great toeLateral calf and, great toeExtensor halluces longus +/-foot dorsiflexion in-vers and evertsNone\\nL5–S1 S1 Back of thigh lat-eral posterior calf, lateral footPosterolateral and lateral calf, and sole of foot, smaller toesGastrocnemius +/– foot eversionAchilles\\nWhiplash injury, an abrupt ﬂexion/extension movement of the cervical \\nspine as a result of sudden acceleration– deceleration, may occur in road \\ntrafﬁc or sporting injuries, and is characterized by localized or diffuse neck and arm pain with muscle spasm, and limited neck movements. The symp-toms may be persistent, although 50% of patients recover within 3 months and 80% within 12 months. The risk factors for chronicity after whiplash include the severity of the initial symptoms and psychological disturbance.\\nIn inﬂammatory arthropathy neck pain is common. Inflammatory \\ntype of pain in atlanto-axial and subaxial subluxation may develop in rheu-matoid arthritis. Immobility due to osteophytic linking of vertebrae may be seen in ankylosing spondylitis.\\nDiffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), also known as For-\\nestier-Rotes-Querol disease, is characterized by the ossification of the\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE347\\nentheses (i.e., enthesopathy). Although the prevalence estimates vary with \\nthe number of bridges used to define the disease, the prevalence of DISH \\nis consistently high and increases with age and obesity.\\nClinical features. Cervical spine ossification is the most extensively stud-\\nied manifestation, as dysphagia due to esophageal compression may require \\nsurgery. As with spondylarthritis, vertebral fractures on a hyperostotic fused \\nspine may escape recognition, placing the patient at risk for complications \\nin the event of subsequent displacement. These fractures are particularly severe, as they often involve the cervical spine and can therefore, cause major neurological impairments. DISH is associated with an increased risk \\nof metabolic syndrome. Various signs and symptoms have been described \\nin patients suffering from DISH, such as polyarticular pain, neck/thoracic/lumbar/extremity pain, acute monoarticular sinovitis, limited range of spi-nal motion, dysphagia, increased susceptibility to unstable spinal fractures, \\nand different degrees of airway obstruction.\\nThe frequency and quality of complaints among these subjects vary by \\nthe site of the pathologic ossification. In contrast, many individuals who are diagnosed with DISH (visible ossifications on imaging studies acquired for \\nother medical reasons) may be completely asymptomatic. Although DISH affects selectively the spine (with predilection to its thoracic portion – the hallmark of the disease is considered to be the ossification of the ante-\\nrolateral aspect of the thoracic spine), it is important to emphasize that \\nthis condition is not limited to the spine and has often been reported to involve multiple peripheral locations as well (extraspinal entheseal ossfica-tions). These include periarticular hyperostosis of the hands, pelvis, knees, \\nelbows, etc. The enthesophytes seen in DISH must be differentiated from \\nosteophytes due to osteoarthritis and from syndesmophytes due to spon-dyloarthritis. Some of the features that help differentiate DISH from other \\npathologic structures are: developing from joints that are rarely affected \\nby osteoarthritis, such as shoulder, elbow, and metacarpophalangeal joints; developing from bone that is distant from the bone–cartilage junction; \\naffecting distinctive entheses such as the calcaneal spur, quadriceps tendon, \\namong others.\\nThe diagnosis of DISH requires at least two (according to Forestier) \\nor three (according to Resnick) contiguous intervertebral bridges, without \\nsevere disk alterations (in contrast to degenerative spinal disease) or anky-\\nlosis of the sacroiliac or facet joints (in contrast to spondylarthritis).\\nCriteria to diagnose diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (according to \\nResnic and Niwayama) are as follows:\\n\\n348\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE• The presence of calcification and ossification along the ventrolateral \\naspects of at least four contiguous vertebral bodies with or without localized pointed excrescences at intervening vertebral body-disc junctions;\\n• The relative preservation of disc height to the evolved areas and the absence of extensive radiographic changes of degenerative disc dis-ease (intervertebral osteochondrosis) including vacuum phenomena and vertebral body marginal sclerosis;\\n• The absence of apophyseal joint bony ankyloses and sacroiliac joint erosion, sclerosis or intraarticular bony fusion.\\nDifferential diagnosis of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and \\nother spondylopathy. The most common conditions that may also present \\nwith bony excrescences, similar to those related to DISH, are spondylosis deformans and ankylosing spondylitis (see Differential diagnosis of arthri-tis). The former disease is by far the most common of the disorders to be considered in the differential diagnosis of DISH. Spondylosis deformans, however, does not affect the anterior longitudinal ligament in the thoracic spine, and that is how one can differentiate these two conditions. The latter disease shares some features occurring in DISH, such as preponderance in males and an association with ligamentous ossification and syndesmo-phytes. One may distinct these two conditions by noting that in ankylosing spondylitis, the bony bridges are slender and vertical, and involve the outer margin of the annulus fibrosus and do not involve the anterior longitudinal ligament. In addition, erosions and bony ankylosis of the sacroiliac and apophyseal joints do not occur in DISH.\\n2. Dorsal (thoracic) pain. Dorsalgia is a less frequent symptom than \\nother rachialgias, which is probably related to the anatomical configuration of the thoracic and spinal column. The dorsal region of the spine represents a static segment, relatively immobile. It is practically rigid due to its artic-ulation with the rib cage, which is why it is exposed to lower mechanical demands.This explains why degenerative and other lesions are well toler-ated at this level. Painful functional syndromes are very common, especially in females. Dorsalgias are accompanied by functional muscular insuffi-ciency, aggravated by inappropriate professional attitudes, depression and other pathological states. Frequently it is a seat of pains irradiated from the territory of the cervicodorsal carcase, and it is also the origin of back pains of the dorsolumbar carcase, referred pain from internal organs – situations that in many cases lead to diagnostic errors and of treatment.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE349\\nCauses of dorsal (thoracic) pain:\\n• Deformities -Scheuermann disease\\n• Inflammatory disease – ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, juvenile chronic arthritis;\\n• Infections – spondylitis, spondylodiscitis, Pott’s morbus;\\n• Degenerative disease – osteoarthritis of the thoracic spine, spon-dylolisthesis, spondylolysis, Forestier and Rotes-Querol disease;\\n• Discopathies – herniated disc;\\n• Trauma– vertebral fractures;\\n• Tumors – primary and metastatic;\\n• Metabolic diseases– osteoporosis, osteomalacia, Paget disease, arthropathy by calcium pyrophosphate crystals;\\n• Dorsalgia nonvertebrales (referred pain) – Herpes zoster, cardiovas-cular diseases, abdominal disease (pancreatobiliary system, peptic ulcer), retroperitoneal disease;\\n• Soft tissue disease and psychogenic origin – mechanical and postural dorsalgia, fibromyalgia, psychogenic rheumatism;\\n• Dorsalgia of young age.\\nScheuermann disease (vertebral epiphysistis) is a juvenile kyphosis \\nwith sinking of the vertebral plates by the intraspinal hernias of Schmorl. In 20% of cases pain may occur progressively, in the form of a fatigue of the dorsal region, which is manifested by ortostatism or physical work (carry-ing the weights) and calms down at rest.\\nStatic dorsalgia. Scoliosis is generally well tolerated, but it becomes \\npainful in the stages of development with severe deformities. Dorsolumbar scoliosis is characterized by more frequent pain in the lumbar region than thoracic back.\\nThoracic outlet syndromes (TOS). The thoracic outlet contains the \\nfirst rib, subclavian artery and vein, brachial plexus, clavicle, and lung apex. Injury to these structures may result in postural or movement-induced pain around the shoulder and supraclavicular region.\\nTrue neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS) is an uncommon \\ndisorder resulting from compression of the lower trunk of the brachial plexus or ventral rami of the C8 or Tl nerve roots, caused most often by an anomalous band of tissue connecting an elongated transverse process at C7 with the first rib. The pain is mild or may be absent. The signs include weakness and wasting of intrinsic muscles of the hand and diminished sensation on the palmar aspect of the fifth digit. An anteroposterior cervi-\\n\\n350\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEcal spine x-ray will show an elongated C7 transverse process (an anatomic \\nmarker for the anomalous cartilaginous band), and EMG and nerve con-duction studies confirm the diagnosis.\\n3. Low back pain (LBP) is the most common musculoskeletal symp-\\ntom and poses a major socio– economic burden. An estimated 80% of the population will experience back pain during their lifetime; 90% of these patients will have resolution of their symptoms within 4 weeks. Sciatica is the result of nerve root impingement and occurs in < 1% of patients. The pain is radicular (and almost invariably radiates below the level of the knee) in the distribution of a lumbosacral nerve root, sometimes accompanied by sensory and motor deﬁcits. Sciatica should be differentiated from non – neurogenic sclerotomal pain, which arises from pathology within the disc, facet joint or paraspinal muscles and ligaments. Sclerotomal pain is non – dermatomal in distribution and often radiates into the lower extremities but not below the knee or with associated paraesthesiae as with sciatica. \\nThere are the following causes of lumbar pain:\\n• Congenital anomalies of the lumbar spine – Spondylolysis, spon-dylolisthesis, sacralization of L5, lumbarization of S1, Spina bifida, congenital canal stenosis, Scheuermann disease;\\n• Trauma and functional or postural overload – muscular contractures and strains, vertebral fractures;\\n• Diseases causing narrowing of the channel and conjunction holes – discal hernia, hypertrophy of the articular veneers (canal stenosis), limb claudication of neurogenic features;\\n• Benign tumors – extradural (osteoma, condroma, osteocondroma, hemagioblastoma, aneurysmal bone cyst), intradural (meningioma, neuroma, lipoma, cysts);\\n• Neoplasia – extradural (metastasis, plasmocytoma/myeloma, sar-coma, chordoma) andintradulal (glioblastoma);\\n• Degenerative disease – osteoarthritis, Forestier and Rotes-Querol disease;\\n• Inflammatory arthritis – ankylosing spondylitis, sacroiliitis not asso-ciated with ankylosing spondylitis, Reiter syndrome, psoriatic arthri-tis, inflammatory bowel disease, non-differentiated spondylartropa-thy;\\n• Diseases of bone metabolism – osteoporosis, Paget disease, osteoma-lacia, acromegaly, hyperparathyroidism, alcaptonuria;\\n• Infectious diseases – pyogenic spondylodiscitis , tuberculous spon-\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE351\\ndylodiscitis, brucellosis spondylodiscitis, other agents (fungi, para-\\nsites);\\n• Pain of visceral origin – dissection of abdominal aortic aneurysm, disease of digestive organs, renourinary, gynecological systems, ret-roperitoneal pathology;\\n• Miscellaneous – Hematological disease (leukemia, multiple mye-loma, haemoglobinopathy, mielophybrosis, mastocytosis), psychiat-ric diseases.\\nLumbar spondylosisIn spondylosis the fundamental lesion is in an intervertebral disc or/and \\na fibrous joint whose tough capsule inserts into the rim of the adjacent ver-tebrae. This capsule encloses a fibrous outer zone and a gel-like inner zone. The disc allows for rotation and bending. Changes in the disc may start in adolescence or early 20s and increase with age. The gel changes chemically, breaks up, shrinks and loses its compliance. The surrounding fibrous zone develops circumferential or radial fissures. In the majority this is initially asymptomatic but visible on MRI as decreased hydration. Later the discs become thinner and less compliant. These changes cause circumferential bulging of disc capsules. Reactive changes develop in adjacent vertebrae; the bone becomes sclerotic and osteophytes form around the rim of the vertebra. The most common sites of spondylosis are L5/S1 and L4/L5 disc prolapse through an adjacent vertebral endplate to produce a Schmorl’s node on X-ray is painless but may accelerate disc degeneration.\\nAs there is no spinal cord in the lumbar spine and because the spinal \\ncanal is usually fairly spacious in the low back, problems in the lumbosacral region (the lumbar spine and sacral region of the spine) usually cause nerve roote problems, not spinal cord injury.\\nSpondylosis may be symptomless, but it can cause episodic mechanical \\nspinal pain, progressive spinal stiffening, acute disc prolapses with or with-out nerve rout irritation, spinal stenosis and spondylolystesis.\\nFacet joint syndrome. Lumbar spondylosis also causes secondary oste-\\noarthritis of the facet joint. The pain is typically worse on bending back-wards and when straightening from flexion. It is lumbar in site, unilateral or bilateral and radiate to the buttock. For example, nerves that exit the cervical spine travel down through the arms, hands, and fingers. Thas is why neck problems that affect a cervical nerve root can cause pain and other symptoms through the arms and hands (radiculopathy), and low back problems that affect a lumbar nerve root can radiate through the leg and\\n\\n352\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEinto the foot (radiculopathy, or sciatica), thus prompting leg pain and/or \\nfoot pain.\\nAcute spinal cord compression is characterized by bilateral pain, lower \\nmotor neuron signs at the level of compression, upper motor neuron and sensory signs below and sphincter disturbance. Symptoms include lower limb weakness, increased tendon reflexes in legs, sensory loss usually 1– 5 levels below cord lesion with sacral lesion. There are the same types of com-pression: bonemetastasis (look for missing pedicle on X-ray), myeloma, cord or paraspinal tumor, TBC and abscess.\\nMRI is the best way to illustrate cord compression, myelopathy, intraspi-\\nnal neoplasms, cists, hemorrhages and abscesses (myelography, plan X-ray and CT are problematic). FBC and ESR are elevated in myeloma, infec-tions, tumors. Urea, creatinin, electrolits, Prostate Specific Antigen, and technetium scan „hot spot” may support the diagnosis and differentiation if there is neoplastic or inflammatory lesion.\\nCauda equina syndrome compression of lumbosacral nerve roots \\n(lower motor neurons, mostly below L1 level) is a neurosurgical emergency. The symptoms include lower limb weakness or alternating or bilateral root pain in legs, depressed tendon reflexes in legs, and sacral paresthesia, saddle anaesthesia, and disturbance of bladder or bowel function.\\nSciatica (lumbosacral radiculopathy) is defined as pain radiating in \\nthe dermatomal distribution. The classic features are aching pain in the buttock and paresthesias radiating into the posterior thigh and calf or into the posterior lateral thigh and lateral fore leg. Radiating pain below the knee is more likely to indicate a true radiculopathy than radiation only to the posterior thigh.\\nSpondylolisthesis forwards lipping of one vertebra on another. This \\noccurs in adolescents and young adults when bilateral congenital pars interarticularis defects cause instability and permit the vertebra to slip, with or without preceding of repeated stress/injury on pars interarticularis.The symptoms include sciatica and low back pain, although it can also be asymptomatic. Rarely a cauda equine syndrome with loss of bladder and anal sphincter control and saddle distribution anaesthesia develops. Low back pain in adolescents’ warrant investigation, and spondylolisthesis requires orthopedic assessment. A degenerative spondylolisthesis may also develop in older people with lumbar spondylosis\\nDisc herniation prolapse of nucleus pulposus through the annulus, \\ndue to intervertebral pressure and degeneration of the ligamentous fib-\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE353\\ners, occurs more commonly in younger patients. If the prolapsed material \\npresses on a nerve root, may cause inflammation and sciatic symptoms. Over 95% of herniated discs affect the L4 -L5 or L5 -S1 interspace. Most herniated discs resolve in 1– 2 weeks with conservative treatment.\\nBack pain in osteoporosis. Osteosclerosis, immobilization, osteomala-\\ncia, the postmenopausal state, renal disease, multiple myeloma, hyperparath-yroidism, hyperthyroidism, metastatic carcinoma, or glucocorticoid use may accelerate osteoporosis and weaken the vertebral body, leading to compres-sion fractures and pain. Up to two-thirds of compression fractures seen on radiologic imaging are asymptomatic. The most common nontraumatic ver-tebral body fractures are due to postmenopausal or senile osteoporosis. The risk of an additional vertebral fracture in 1 year following a first vertebral fracture is 20%. The presence of fever, weight loss, fracture at a level above T4, or the conditions described above should increase suspicion for a cause other than senile osteoporosis. The sole manifestation of a compress on frac-ture may be localized back or radicular pain exacerbated by movement and often reproduced by palpation over the spinous process of the affected ver-tebra. The relief of acute pain can often be achieved with acetaminophen or a combination of opioids and acetaminophen. The role of NSAIDs is controversial. Both pain and disability are improved with bracing.\\nFibrositic nodulosis causes unilateral or bilateral low back pain, radiating \\nto the buttock and upper posterior thigh. There are tender nodules in the upper buttock and along the iliac crest. Such nodules are relevant only if they are ten\\n-\\nder and associated with pain. They are probably traumatic. Local intralesional corticosteroids injections help.\\nSway back (back pain of pregnancy). Low back pain in pregnancy \\nreflects altered spinal posture and increased ligamentous laxity. Weight control and pre– and post-natal exercises are helpful, and pain usually set-tles after delivery.\\nInfection /inflammation as a cause of back pain. Fever or an elevated \\nwhite blood cell count is found in a minority of patients. MRI and CT are sensitive and specific for early detection of osteomyelitis. CT may be more readily available in emergency settings and better tolerated by some patients with severe back pain.\\nSpinal Septic Arthritis. Vertebral osteomyelitis is often caused by staph -\\nylococci, but other bacteria or tuberculosis (Pott\\'s disease) may be respon -\\nsible. The primary source of infection is usually the urinary tract, skin, or lungs. Intravenous drug use is a well-recognized risk factor. Whenever pyo\\n-\\n\\n354\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEgenic osteomyelitis is found, the possibility of bacterial endocarditis should \\nbe considered. This condition should be suspected in patients with acute or chronic, unrelenting back pain associated with fever and marked local tenderness. Back pain unrelieved by rest, spine tenderness over the involved spine segment, and an elevated ESR are the most common findings in ver\\n-\\ntebral osteomyelitis. The thoracolumbar region is most commonly affected. The intervertebral disk can also be affected by infection (diskitis) and, very rarely, by tumor.\\nSpinal epidural abscess presents with back pain (aggravated by move-\\nment or palpation), fever, radiculopathy, or signs of spinal cord compres-sion. The subacute development of two or more of these findings should increase the index of suspicion for spinal epidural abscess. The abscess may track over multiple spinal levels and is best delineated by spine MRI. An antecedent infection or procedure predisposing to bacteremia may help suggest this diagnosis. Imaging studies usually have evidence for infection crossing the disk space. In tuberculous spinal septic arthritis (Pott disease), the site of involvement is most commonly T10-L2, and there is usually an associated paraspinal abscess. Intravertebral disk infection is often difficult to diagnose because pain patterns may be unusual and localizing signs may be absent. Bone scanning may be helpful, but magnetic resonance imaging may be very helpful, particularly because of the ability to show an spread of infection into surrounding tissues.\\nInflammatory rheumatologic back pain. The onset of back pain prior \\nto the age 30 and an „inflammatory” quality of the back pain (morning stiffness and pain that improve with activity) should raise the possibility of ankylosing spondylitis. In this case it is important to do a test for ankylos-ing spondylitis (Table 24). In contrast to ankylosing spondylitis, rheuma-toid arthritis predominantly affects multiple, small, peripheral joints of the hands and feet. Rheumatoid arthritis spares the sacroiliac joints and only affects the cervical component of the spine. Bilateral sacroiliitis indistin-guishable from ankylosing spondylitis is seen with the spondylitis associ-ated with inflammatory bowel disease. Sacroiliitis associated with reactive arthritis and psoriasis, on the other hand, is often asymmetric or even uni-lateral. Diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) causes exuberant osteophytes („enthesophytes”) of the spine that occasionally are difficult to distinguish from the syndesmophytes of ankylosing spondylitis. The enthe-sophytes of DISH are thicker and more anterior than the syndesmophytes of ankylosing spondylitis, and the sacroiliac joints are normal in DISH.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE355\\nTable 24\\nResults of testing in ankylosing spondylitis\\nTest Method Results\\nSchober Make a mark on the spine at level of \\nL5 and one at 10 cm directly above with the patient. Patient then bends forward maximally and the distance between the two marks is measured.An increase of < 5 cm indicates early lumbar in-volvement standing erect.\\nChest  expansionMeasure maximal chest expansion at nipple line.Chest expansion of < 5 cm is a clue to early costover-tebral involvement.\\nSacroiliac compressionExert direct compression over sacro-iliac joints.Tenderness or pain sug-gests sacroiliac involve-ment.\\nNeoplastic back pain is the most common neurologic symptom in \\npatients with systemic cancer and is the presenting symptom in 20% of \\npatients. The cause is usually vertebral body metastasis but it can also result from spread of cancer through the intervertebral foramen (especially with lymphoma), from carcinomatous meningitis, or from metastasis to the spi-nal cord. Cancer-related back pain tends to be constant, dull, unrelieved by rest, and worse at night. By contrast, mechanical low back pain usu-ally improves with rest. MRI, CT, and CT myelography are the studies of choice when spinal metastasis is suspected. Once a metastasis is found, imaging of the entire spine reveals additional tumor deposits in one third of patients. MRI is preferred for soft tissue definition, but the most rap-idly available imaging modality is best because the patient\\'s condition may worsen quickly without intervention. Fewer than 5% of patients who are non-ambulatory at the time of diagnosis ever regain the ability to walk; thus, the early diagnosis is crucial.\\nReferred pain from visceral disease. Diseases of the thorax, abdomen, \\nor pelvis may refer pain to the posterior portion of the spinal segment that innervates the diseased organ. Occasionally, back pain may be the first and only manifestation. Upper abdominal diseases generally refer pain to the lower thoracic or upper lumbar region (eighth thoracic to the first and sec-ond lumbar vertebrae), lower abdominal diseases to the midlumbar region (second to fourth lumbar vertebrae), and pelvic diseases to the sacral region. Local signs (pain with spine palpation, paraspinal muscle spasm) are absent and little or no pain accompanies routine movements of the spine.\\n\\n356\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINELow thoracic or lumbar pain with abdominal disease tumors of the pos-\\nterior wall of the stomach or duodenum typically produce epigastric pain, \\nbut midline back or paraspinal pain may occur if retroperitoneal extension is present. Fatty foods occasionally induce back pain associated with biliary disease. Diseases of the pancreas can produce right or left paraspinal back pain. Pathology in retroperitoneal structures (hemorrhage, tumors, pyelo-nephritis) can produce paraspinal pain that radiates to the lower abdomen, groin or anterior thighs. A mass in the iliopsoas region can produce unilat-eral lumbar pain with radiation toward the groin, labia, or testicle. The sud-den appearance of lumbar pain in a patient receiving anticoagulant therapy suggests retroperitoneal hemorrhage.\\nBack pain in psychiatric disease. Chronic low back pain may be \\nencountered in patients who seek financial compensation, in malingerers or in those with concurrent substance abuse. Many patients with chronic low back pain have a history of psychiatric illness (depression, anxiety states) or childhood trauma (physical or other type of abuse) that antedates the onset of back pain.\\nIdiopathic back pain. The cause of low back pain occasionally remains \\nunclear. Some patients have had multiple operations for disk disease but have persistent pain and disability. The original indications for surgery may have been questionable, with back pain only, no definite neurologic signs, or a minor disk bulge noted on CT or MRI. Scoring systems based on neurologic signs, psychological factors, physiologic studies, and imaging studies should be used to minimize the likelihood of unsuccessful surgery.\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\n1.

When differentiating a clinical picture, fre-\\nquently it is initially impossible to identify the real diagnosis. Until rele-\\nvant findings are present, one has to be content with the classification into one of the groups of diseases. In all unclear cases, consideration is almost always given to this at the beginning of the differential diagnostic process. This approach is frequently chosen because a diagnosis in the conventional sense is not always easy to make, as more than one diagnosis can often be possible at the same time.\\nImmune mediated diseases1.

The prevalence of musculoskeletal damage with high frequency of arthritis predominates is noted. The central nervous system and renal system deprivation, giving a favorable prognosis and serologically frequent detection of antibodies anti-SS-A/Ro or anti-DNAmc, sometimes in the absence of antinuclear antibodies occur.\\nDiscoid SLE – Chronic skin lesions are present in the absence of sys-\\ntemic damage. Skin lesions are on the face, scalp, ears are erythematous and evolve with central atrophy and scarring, with definitive loss of appendages through follicular obstruction, telangiectasia, definitive alopecia. In 5% of cases it can turn to the systemic form.\\nLatent SLE – defines the situation where only one or two ACR cri-\\nteria for SLE are present and a series of clinico-biological manifestations suggestive of autoimmune disease. There may be fever, physical asthenia, arthralgia, adenopathy, headache, neuropathies, against background of modified biological tests: increased ESR, hypocomplementemia, hyper-gammaglobulinemia, present rheumatoid factor. Some authors recom-mend the classification as undifferentiated connective tissue disease, the prognosis being good due to the evolution either to SLE without affecting the central nervous system and kidney, or stationary. Complement activity (increased/decreased) may be seen not only in SLE.\\n\\n360\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEIncreased complement activity may be seen in:\\n• Cancer\\n• Certain infections\\n• Ulcerative colitis\\nDecreased complement activity may occur:• Systemic lupus erythematosis\\n• Lupus nephritis\\n• Cirrhosis\\n• Glomerulonephritis\\n• Hereditary angioedema\\n• Hepatitis\\n• Kidney transplant\\xa0rejection\\n• Malnutrition.\\nDrug-Induced Lupus. Drug-induced SLE shows a direct relation of the \\ndisease with the consumption of drugs, and disappearance of the disease after discontinuation of the drugs. The drugs most commonly associated with drug-induced lupus are shown in Table 26. The clinical symptoms of drug-induced SLE mainly include fever, arthralgia, myalgia, and pleu-ropericarditis. Kidney and central nervous system manifestations are occur rarely, and the laboratory complement factors C3 and C4 therefore remain normal. Anti-DNA antibodies are mostly negative. Antinuclear antibodies and antibodies to histones and chromatin are positive.\\nClinical features compared to systemic lupus, drug -induced lupus has \\nthe following features: middle age presentation, no gender difference, no ‘‘blacks,’’ acute onset, less cutaneous, renal, neurologic, and hematologic involvement, but equal joint, hepatic, and constitutional symptoms. Usually anti-histone antibody positive, anti-Smith negative, anti-dsDNA negative and normal complement levels.\\nTable 26\\nAgents implicated in drug-induced SLE\\nDefinite Probable\\nCommon\\nBeta-blockers, Carbamaze-pine, Chlorpromazine,D-Penicillamine, Ethosuxi-mide, Hydralazine, Isoniazid, Hydantoins, Methyldopa,Phenytoin, Procainamide, Sul-fasalazineAmiodarone, Atenolol, Acebutolol, Captopril, Diclofenac, Estrogens, Ethanercept, Gold salts,Interferone, Infliximab,Lithium carbonate, Minocycline,Nalodixid acid, Oral contraceptive, Penicillin,Proctolol, Psoralen,Propylthiouracil, Quinidine,Spironolactone,Statins,Tetracycline\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE361\\nDifferential diagnosis of SLE is difficult in the onset of disease when \\nsymptoms and signs are diverse and variable. The differentiation should be \\nwith:\\n• Felty’s syndrome,\\n• rheumatoid arthritis\\n• mixed connective tissue disease\\nFelty’s syndrome is characterized by symmetric arthritis of the small \\njoints, with bycitopeny-leukopenia and thrombocytopenia, splenomegaly; radiologic investigation show erosive arthritis with destruction of the joint tissue (rheumatoid arthritis pictures); biological tests are without SLE immunological markers.\\nRheumatoid arthritis can be confused with SLE with inherent articular \\nexpression, especially at the onset of both conditions, when other addi-tional criteria for diagnosis are absent. Raynaud’s phenomenon, rheuma-toid factor, acute phase reactants at elevated levels, and sometimes antinu-clear antibodies may coexist. Instead, identifying an anti-CCP antibodies can distinguish in favor of RA. Important difficulties arise with the overlap syndrome-AR and LES, when the immunological picture can translate the diagnosis.\\nMixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD) or Overlap Syndrome (Sharp \\nSyndrome). MCTD is characterized by combination of clinical features of \\nmore than one connective tissue disease (systemic lupus erythematosus, progressive scleroderma, and polymyositis).\\nSymptoms. The primary features of MCTD are variable and include fea-\\ntures of SLE, polymyositis, systemic sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis: the association of arthralgia and arthritis (96%), swelling of hands and fin-gers (88%), Raynaud syndrome (84%), myositis, acrosclerosis and myositis which mainly affect proximal muscles in the extremities (72%).\\nThe involvement of the kidney is rare, and the response to corticoster-\\noids is positive. After many years, however, MCTD progresses into pro-gressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), and myositis lupus– like symptoms are no longer the leading symptoms.\\nDiagnosis. High titers of antinuclear antibodies directed to ribonucle-\\nase-sensitive ribonucleoprotein (RNP) are characteristic, but they have also been reported to occur in other connective tissue diseases. It is serologically characterized by a positive antinuclear antibody and by a high titer of the autoantibody anti-U1-70 RNP antibodies at the titer ≥ 1:1600; constantly missing anti-antibody anti nDNA and antiSm.\\n\\n362\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEThe antiphospholipid syndrome. The primary antiphospholipid antibody \\nsyndrome represents 50% of cases.\\nClinical features. There is an association between the presence of the \\nlupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies and recurrent venous \\nor arterial thrombosis. Thrombotic events described have included stroke, transient ischemic attacks, myocardial infarctions, brachial artery throm-bosis, deep venous thrombophlebitis, retinal vein thrombosis, hepatic vein thrombosis resulting in Budd-Chiari syndrome, and pulmonary hyperten-sion. Other manifestations include recurrent fetal loss, thrombocytopenia, positive results of Coombs test, migraines, chorea, epilepsy, chronic leg ulcers, livedo reticularis, and progressive dementia resulting from cerebro-vascular accidents. Acquired valvar heart disease, especially aortic insuffi-ciency, has been described. Although many patients with lupus and other diseases can have lupus anticoagulant or antiphospholipid antibodies, of either IgG or IgM class, thrombosis will not necessarily develop. Patients with the highest levels of antiphospholipid antibodies are more prone to thrombosis than those with lower levels. Also, IgG antiphospholipid antibody is more strongly associated with recurrent thrombosis than IgM antiphospholipid antibody.\\nSensitive tests for detection of lupus anticoagulants:• plasma clotting time,\\n• kaolin clotting time,\\n• platelet neutralization procedure,\\n• modified Russell viper venom time.\\nMany, but not all, patients with the lupus anticoagulant have also \\nincreased IgG or IgM antiphospholipid antibody levels. The hallmark of the antiphospholipid antibody syndrome is prolongation on all phospho-lipid-dependent coagulation tests.\\nThe antibodies prolong the partial thromboplastin time at the level of \\nthe prothrombin activator complex of the clotting cascade.\\nLupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies are associated with:• SLE, \\n• malignancy,\\n• infectious,\\n• drug-induced diseases.\\nOther associated diseases are• Sjögren syndrome,\\n• rheumatoid arthritis,\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE363\\n• idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura,\\n• Behçet syndrome,\\n• myasthenia gravis, and mixed connective tissue disease.\\nThe antibodies (lupus anticoagulant and antiphospholipid antibodies) \\nare also found in persons with no apparent disease but in whom recurrent \\nthrombosis develops.\\nThe differential diagnosis can be done to analyzed for multiple neurolog-\\nical, renal, pleuro-pulmonary, cardiovascular, muscular, articular disorders – but with no particular and specific SLE and immunological context.\\n2. Progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS)Definition. Progressive systemic sclerosis is an autoimmune disease which \\naffects connective tissue and leads to fibrosis. The fibrosis is mainly seen in the skin (scleroderma), lung, gastrointestinal tract, heart, and kidney. The major criteria are symmetric induration of the skin of the fingers and the skin prox-imal to the metacarpophalangeal or metatarsophalangeal joints. The minor criteria are sclerodactyly, digital pitting scars or loss of substance from the finger pad, and bibazial pulmonary fibrosis. One major criterion or two or more minor criteria need to be present for the diagnosis of systemic sclerosis.\\nTable 27\\nClinical manifestations of limited and systemic scleroderma\\nSystemic Sclerosis Limited Diffuse\\nGeneral Fatigue, weight loss\\nSkin Thickening on distal extremities \\nand face onlyThickening on extremities (incl. digits), face, and trunk\\nNails Capillary dropout +/– dilatation Capillary dropout & dila-tation\\nPulmonary PAH > fibrosis Fibrosis > PAH\\nGastrointestinal GERD, hypomotility, PBC GERD, hypomotility\\nRenal Renovascular HTN\\nCardiac Restrictive cardiomyopathy\\nOther CREST syndrome = Calcinosis, Raynaud’s Esophageal dysmotility Sclerodactyly, TelangiectasiasRaynaud’s phenomenon \\nAntibodies Anticentromere (70%) Anti-Scl 70 (40%)\\nPrognosis Survival >70% at 10 years Survival 40–60% at 10 years\\nDifferential diagnosis of scleroderma early in its course can cause diagnos-\\ntic confusion with other causes of Raynaud phenomenon, particularly SLE, \\nmixed connective tissue disease, and inflammatory myopathies. Scleroderma can be mistaken for other disorders characterized by skin hardening.\\n\\n364\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINERaynaud phenomenon (RP) is a syndrome of paroxysmal biphasic or \\ntriphasic color changes (pallor, cyanosis, erythema) accompanied by pain \\nand numbness in the hands or feet digital ischemia, most commonly caused by an exaggerated response of digital arterioles to cold or emotional stress. The initial phase of RP , mediated by excessive vasoconstriction, consists of well-demarcated digital pallor or cyanosis; the subsequent (recovery) phase of RP , caused by vasodilation, leads to intense hyperemia and rubor. Although the fingers are chiefly affected, RP can also affect toes and other acral areas such as the nose and ears. RP is classified as primary (idiopathic or Raynaud disease) or secondary. It usually persists for more than 2 years before the skin changes develop.\\nPrimary form of Raynaud phenomenon/disease (50%) is benign, exept \\nfor all secondary causes. In primary Raynaud disease, are usually affected females. The ratio women: males =5:1. The onset is at menarche, usually all digits are involved, and attacks are very frequent. The severity of symptoms is mild to moderate, and they can be precipitated by emotional stress. In male patients with Raynaud phenomenon, a rare occurrence, a connective tissue disease may develop. Although Raynaud phenomenon is common in females, it is usually not associated with a connective tissue disease unless the patient has positive results for antinuclear antibody, which suggest that a connective tissue disease may develop in the future. Digital ulceration and finger edema are rare, as is periungual erythema. Livedo reticularis is frequent.\\nClinical features: mild symmetric episodic attacks with no evidence \\nof peripheral vascular disease, no tissue injury, normal nail fold capillary examination. Biological tests: negative ANA, normal ESR.\\nSecondary form of RP can cause digital ulceration or gangrene. Typically, \\npatients are over 35 years of age and there is presence of different diseases (Table 28).\\nMales and females are affected with Raynaud phenomenon due to a con-\\nnective tissue disease. It often begins in a single digit, and attacks are usually infrequent (zero to five a day). It is moderate to severe, and the disorder is not precipitated by emotional stress. Skin capillary microscopy reveals tor-tuous, dilated capillary loops in systemic sclerosis, mixed connective tissue disease, and polymyositis. They may also be present in patients with Ray-naud phenomenon who will develop further systemic sclerosis, polymyosi-tis, or mixed connective tissue disease. Digital ulceration, finger edema, and periungual erythema are frequent. Livedo reticularis is uncommon.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE365\\nTable 28\\nCauses of secondary Raynaud phenomenon\\nChemotherapeutic \\nagentsBleomycin, Vinblastine, polyvinyl clorid, beta-blockers, estrogen, progesterone, nicotine\\nToxins Vinyl chloride\\nVibration-induced injuriesJack hammer use\\nVascular occlusive disorders (Obstructive artheriopathy)Thoracic outlet obstruction Atherosclerosis Vasculitis Brachiocephalic atherosclerosis, thrombosis, embolism, external compression\\nRheumatic and auto-immune diseasesConnective tissue diseasesScleroderma, 90%-100%Mixed connective tissue disease, 90%-100%Systemic lupus erythematosus, 15%Rheumatoid arthritis, <10%PolymyositisTakayasu vasculitis, giant cells arteriitis, primary biliary cirrhosiscarpian tunnel chanal syndrome, chest defile thoracic syndrome\\nPhysical aggression Vibrations, frost-bite, trauma of large vessels \\nVasospastic diseases Migraine or vascular headache, Prinzmetal angina pec-toris,\\nEndocrine diseases Feochromocytoma, Carcinoid syndrome\\nNeurological diseases Poliomyelitis, siringomiely, hemyplegy\\nNeoplasia Ovarian tumor, angiocentric lymphoma\\nMiscellaneous Blood abnormalitiesCryoglobulinemiaCold agglutininsIncreased blood viscosity cryofibrinogenemia, parapro-teinemia, polycithemia,\\nInfections Parvovirus B19, Helicobacter pylori\\nOthers Nervous anorexia, algoneurodystrophy\\nCREST syndrome. This is characterized by calcinosis cutis, Raynaud \\nphenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, and telangiectasias. \\nSkin involvement progresses slowly and is limited to the extremities. The development of internal organ involvement occurs but is delayed. Lung involvement occurs in 70% of patients. Diffusing capacity may be low, and pulmonary hypertension can develop. The latter is more common in CREST than in diffuse scleroderma. Bosentan was recently approved for severe pulmonary hypertension, scleroderma, and CREST syndrome. The onset of Raynaud phenomenon occurs less than 2 years before the skin\\n\\n366\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEchanges. Anticentromere antibody is found in 70% to 90% of patients and \\nantiscleroderma-70 antibody – in 10%. The incidence of primary biliary cirrhosis is increased.\\nCircumscribed sclerodermaCircumscribed scleroderma (morphea) must be differentiated from \\nprogressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), as it is limited to the skin, and pre-sents neither with acral lesions not with Raynaud syndrome. Various der-mal manifestations have been described: focal forms (morpheaen plaques), linear (scleroderma en coup de sabre, sword stroke) and patchy (morphea guttata) ones.The prognosis of circumscribed scleroderma is favorable. Spontaneous remissions are frequent (50%), and transition to PSS is rare.\\nScleroederma adultorum (Buschke Syndrome)In both adolescents and women, a scleroderma-like disease, named \\nscleroderma adultorum, develops within one to six weeks after an infec-tion, usually streptococcal one, and initially affects the throat. However, the whole body can become involved. The prognosis is favorable, and the disease resolves after six to 12 months.\\nOne form of PSS is Thibièrge−Weissenbach syndrome (calcinosis of the \\nskin, tendons, bursas). Systemic diseases of the connective tissues occur either separately or combined with other collagenoses. Sometimes it is hard to define the clinical unit exactly and therefore these states are called overlap syndromes or close syndromes. One of such collagenoses coinciding with these diseases is calcinosis. It is most often found in children but rarely in adults.\\nScleroderma-Like Syndromes Disorders associated with occupation or \\nenvironment. This group includes polyvinyl chloride disease, organic sol-vents, jackhammer disease, silicosis, and toxic oil syndrome.\\nScleroderma-like diseases also occur in graft-versus-host disease (GVH) \\nafter bone marrow transplantation, in primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and in intestinal carcinoid syndrome.\\nAn association with silicone breast implants has been suggested but \\nremains unverified.\\nMetabolic Causes of Scleroderma-Like Syndrome This group includes \\nporphyria, amyloidosis, carcinoid, and diabetes mellitus (flexion contrac-tures of the tendons in the hands, cheiropathy, can develop).\\nIn graft-versus-host disease skin induration develops in up to 30% of \\npatients after bone marrow transplantation.\\nDrug-induced disorders are caused by carbidopa, bleomycin, and bro-\\nmocriptine.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE367\\nPulmonary fibrosis is observed from exposure to busulfan, bleomycin, \\nand trichloroethylene.\\nEosinophilic myalgia syndrome is associated with ingestion of contam-\\ninated L-tryptophan. Eosinophilia, myositis, skin induration, fasciitis, and \\nperipheral neuropathy develop. Skin changes are similar to those of eosin-ophilic fasciitis. There is a poor response to steroids.\\nScleroderma frequently occurs after streptococcal upper respiratory tract \\ninfection in children. It is usually self-limiting. Swelling of the head and neck is common. In adults, diabetes mellitus often is associated. Cocaine use and appetite suppressants also cause scleroderma-like illness.\\nEosinophilic fasciitis (Shulman syndrome) is a rare scleroderma-like dis-\\nease presenting with skin changes that resemble diffuse scleroderma. The inflammatory abnormalities are limited to the fascia rather than the der-mis and epidermis and are characterized by subepidermal, eosinophilic skin indurations of the extremities with heavily reduced agility of the joints. Patients with eosinophilic fasciitis are distinguished from those with sclero-derma by the presence of peripheral blood eosinophilia, absence of Raynaud phenomenon, good response to prednisone, and association (in some cases) with paraproteinemia. The hallmark of this disease is a distinct eosinophilia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Antinuclear antibodies are absent. A good response to systemic treatment with corticosteroid has been observed, and the disease resolves within two to 19 months. There is no involvement of the internal organs.\\nScleromyxedema. Diffuse skin thickening and visceral involvement are \\nthe features of scleromyxedema.The presence of paraprotein, the absence of Raynaud phenomenon, and distinct skin histology point to scleromyxe-dema. That is associated with IgG monoclonal protein.\\nDiabetic cheiropathy typically develops in long-standing, poorly con-\\ntrolled diabetes and can mimic sclerodactyly.\\nNephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy produces thickening and hardening \\nof the skin of the trunk and extremities in patients with chronic kidney disease; exposure to gadolinium may play a pathogenic role.\\nMorphea and linear sclerodermas cause sclerodermatous changes lim-\\nited to circumscribed areas of the skin and usually have excellent outcomes.\\nDifferential diagnosis of Progressive systemic sclerosis must be distin-\\nguished from\\n• rheumatoid arthritis,\\n• SLE,\\n\\n368\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE• Raynaud syndrome,\\n• dermatomyositis,\\n• Sjögren syndrome,\\n• mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD) or Sharp syndrome. Many \\nof the patients described by Sharp in 1972 later developed PSS in the course of their disease.\\n3. Polymiositis and dermatomyositisThe clinical picture is dominated by nonsuppurative inflammation of \\nthe striated muscle, causing proximal muscle weakness. When the skin is involved it is called dermatomyositis.\\nIn clinical pictures of polymyositis the major feature is proximal muscle \\nweakness which is progressive. There is wasting of the shoulder and pelvic girdle muscles with pain, weakness and tenderness. Patients have difficulty squatting, going up stairs, rising from a chair and rising their hands above the head. Respiratory muscles are affected in severe disease (in Jo1 antibod-ies positive patients) and may require ventilation. Dysphagia is seen in 50% of patients owing to esophageal muscle involvement. Arthralgia occurs in 25-30% of cases and as a rule is mild. Cutaneous feature includes a heli-otrope (purple) discoloration of the eyelids and periorbital oedema. Scaly, purple-red raised vasculitic patches occur over the extensor surface of joints and fingers (collodion patches). Ulcerative vasculitis and calcinosis of the subcutaneous tissue are common in the childhood form and occur in 25% of adults. In the long term, muscle fibrosis and contractures of joints occur. There is an association with other autoimmune disease (SLE, RA, SS) with Raynaud’s phenomenon.\\nThere is also an association with malignancy (lung, ovary, breast, stom-\\nach) which can predate the onset of myositis. This occurs in males with dermatomyositis.\\nInflammatory myopathyes are classified as polymyositis, dermatomyosi-\\ntis, and inclusion body myositis associated with malignancy (gastrointes-tinal, lung, ovarian, breast, lymphoma) in >45% of patients. The clinical features of proximal, symmetric, progressive muscle weakness developing over weeks to months, may be associated with morning stiffness. Muscle pain is not common. Extramuscular manifestations include arthralgias, car-diac signs (conduction abnormalities, cardiomyopathy), respiratory signs (muscle weakness, aspiration, interstitial lung disease), skin manifestations (Gottron’s papules (dorsal aspect of MCP and IP joints/elbows/knees), heliotrope rash (over the upper eyelids with periorbital edema), V rash/\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE369\\nshawl sign (erythematous rash over upper chest/back/shoulders), peri-\\nunghal telangiectasia, mechanic’s hand (with darkened horizontal lines across the lateral and palmar aspects of fingers/ hands), and constitutional symptoms. Reflexes are usually normal.

Polyarteriitis nodosa (PAN) is a systemic necrotizing vasculitis. It \\nbrings together polymorphic manifestations with multisystem, cutaneous, \\ncardiovascular, neurological, renal, digestive, articular, similar LES, with the presence of rheumatoid factor and decrease complement. PAN affects predominantly males aged 50-60. Vasculitis is dominant, angiographicaly and histopathologicaly objectivized. Serological level of p ANCA may be elevated and HBV and HCV markers were positive in 10-50% of patients. But there are no photosensitivity phenomena; antibodies anti DNAn, antiSm, anticardiolipin are negative.\\nThe criteria of PAN (American College of Rheumatology 1990), when \\na radiographic or pathological diagnosis of vasculitis is made are the fol-lowing:\\n• Weight loss greater than/equal to 4.5 kg\\n• Livedo reticularis\\xa0 (a mottled purplish skin discoloration over the extremities or torso)\\n• Testicular pain or tenderness (occasionally, a site biopsied for diag-nosis)\\n• Muscle pain, weakness, or leg tenderness\\n• Nerve disease (either single or multiple)\\n• Diastolic blood pressure greater than 90 mmHg (high blood pres-sure)\\n• Elevated kidney blood tests (BUN greater than 40 mg/dl or\\xa0creati-nine greater than 1.5 mg/dl)\\n• Hepatitis B (not C) virus tests positive (for surface antigen or anti-body)\\n• Arteriogram (angiogram) showing the arteries that are dilated (aneurysms) or constricted by the blood vessel inflammation\\n• Biopsy of tissue showing arteritis (typically inflamed arteries): The\\xa0sural nerve\\xa0is a frequent location for the biopsy.\\nA patient is said to have polyarteritis nodosa if he/she has three of the \\n10 signs known.\\n5. Wegener’s granulomatosis. The presence of cutaneous, neurological \\nand articular lesions may clinically suggest SLE.\\nDiagnostic criteria:– Necrotizing granulomas in respiratory tract,\\n– Generalized necrotizing arteritis,\\n– Glomerulonephritis,\\nAny organ may be involved, eg nasal ulcers, epistaxis, rhinitis, sinus\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE371\\ninvolvement, otitis media (+/– sensoneural deafness/ vertigo), multiple cra-\\nnial nerve lesions, oral ulcers, gum hypertrophy+/– bleeding and micro-abscesses, lung symptoms and variable shadows on chest X ray. Eye signs are proptosis +/– ptosis (orbital granuloma), conjunctivitis, corneal ulcers, episcleritis, scleritis, uveitis, retinitis.\\nThe clinical distinction is achieved by signs of the upper respiratory \\ntract, lung and ocular damage, as well as by the high specific identification of antibodies c– ANCA anti PR3.\\n6. Allergic vasculitisChurg – Strauss syndrome has similarities with SLE – purpura phe-\\nnomena, Reynaud phenomenon, glomerular, pleural, cardiac and neurolog-ical impairment. But the distinction is made by the presence of characteris-tic respiratory manifestations – severe asthmatic attacks with aggravations that precede the manifestations of vasculitis, maxillary sinusitis, allergic rhinitis, nasal polyposis, respiratory failure. Biological tests are specific– constant eosinophilia and characteristic->1000/mm\\n3, serological IgE ele-\\nvated, antibody ANCA – positive, especially in antimieloperoxidasic type.\\nMicroscopic polyangiitis has cutaneous, renal, neurological signs that \\nmay suggest SLE, but there is respiratory impairment, cANCA antibodies and p ANCA (absent in LES), lacking antibodies anti DNAn.dc and anti Sm.\\nHaemoblastosis – such as acute and chronic leukemia, lymphomas, may \\nsuggest SLE by fever, adenoma gals, splenomegaly, joint, pleural, and neu-rological affections – but there is a characteristic feature and medullary hematology and missing antibodies anti DNAn.dc and anti Sm.\\nSjögren’s syndrome is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease with \\nclinical symptoms characterized by keratoconjunctivitis sicca, xerostomia, and intermittent swelling of salivary glands. The histopathology of the sali- vary glands has been well documented and consists of infiltration of the glands with lymphoid cells associated with atrophy of acinar glands. At times, lymphocyte infiltration is so extensive that lymphoid follicles are present in these tissues. Sjogren’s syndrome however can be found in asso-ciation with other connective tissue diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA), progressive systemic sclerosis (PSS), and systemic lupus erythema-tosus (SLE). In addition, complications of the disease such as renal tubular acidosis, myopathy, and plasma cell dyscrasias are frequently encountered.\\nSecondary Sjögren syndrome accompanying another connective tissue \\ndisease is not classified as an overlap syndrome.\\n\\n372\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEConnective tissue disease – associated vasculitis\\nIt is vasculitis associated with RA, SLE, or Sjögren’s syndrome.Its clinical manifestations are distal arteritis– digital ischemia, livedo \\nreticularis, palpable purpura, cutaneous ulceration; visceral arteritis – per-icarditis and mesenteric ischemia; peripheral neuropathy. Diagnosis. Skin and sural nerve biopsy, angiography, electromyiography; decreased comple-ment in SLE, positive in RA.\\nUndifferentiated connective tissue disease-overlap syndrome with clin-\\nical features of two or more rheumatologic disorders (RA, SLE, Sjogren’s syndrome, scleroderma, inflammatory myopathies).This category includes patients with symptoms that do not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for a defi-nite or specific connective tissue disease. The common symptoms include Raynaud phenomenon, arthralgias, fatigue, and variable joint or soft tissue swelling. The antinuclear antibody may be positive, but other autoantibod-ies are not present.\\nRheumatic (vasculitic) manifestations of HIV include diffuse infiltra-\\ntive lymphocytosis syndrome (with parotid gland enlargement, the glands are infiltrated with CD8 lymphocytes) that is manifested by xerostomia, xerophthalmia, and salivary gland swelling mimicking Sjögren syndrome, lupus-like syndrome, systemic vasculitis of the necrotizing a hypersensi-tivity type and myositis. In contrast to Sjögren syndrome, HIV-positive patients usually do not have antibodies to SS-A or SS-B and are usually rheumatoid factor-negative. There is an acquired immunodeficiency syn-drome-associated myopathy that may be viral. There is also myopathy due to zidovudine therapy. Fibromyalgia has also been reported in up to 25% of HIV-infected patients. The introduction of HAART (Highly Active Anti-Retroviral\\xa0 Therapy) has been associated with a marked decreased frequency of painful articular syndromes, psoriatric arthritis, spondyloar-thropathy, increased frequency of the immune reconstituition inflamma-tory syndrome (IRIS) and osteoporosis.\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\n1.

Initially, all febrile illnesses are Fevers of \\nUnknown Origin (FUOs). However, FUOs are an unusual and heteroge-\\nneous group of prolonged febrile disorders that elude diagnosis even after intensive investigation for an internist.\\nDEFINITION.\\nClassic definition: Petersdorf (1961) and Beeson suggested the follow-\\ning criteria for the definition of FUO:\\n• Fever ≥38.3°C [ ≥101°F], on several occasions\\n• Fever persisting without diagnosis for at least ≥3 weeks,\\n• At least one week investigation in hospital\\nA new definition which includes the outpatient setting (which reflects \\ncurrent medical practice) is broader, stipulating:\\n• 3 outpatient visits or\\n• 3 days in the hospital without elucidation of a cause or\\n• One week of \"intelligent and invasive\" ambulatory investigation.\\nETIOLOGY AND EPIDEMIOLOGY. The range of FUO etiolo-\\ngies has evolved over time as a result of changes in the spectrum of diseases causing FUO, the widespread use of antibiotics, and the availability of new diagnostic techniques. The proportion of cases caused by intraabdominal abscesses and tumors, for example, has decreased because of earlier detec-tion by CT and ultrasound; infective endocarditis is a less frequent cause because blood culture and echocardiographic techniques have improved. Acute HIV infection were unknown four decades ago. Neoplasms and noninfectious inflammatory diseases (NIIDs), the latter including collagen or rheumatic diseases,”vasculitis syndromes”, and granulomatous disorders are next in frequency. Many NIIDs can be diagnosed only after prolonged observation and exclusion of other diseases. The percentage of undiagnosed cases of FUO has increased in more recent studies.\\nCommon causes of FUO:• Infections (23%–36%): Tuberculosis, endocarditis, local suppurative process (e.g., biliary tract, kidney), septic thrombophlebitis, cyto-megalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus, etc.\\n• Neoplastic disease (7%–31%): Lymphoma, leukemia, renal cell car-\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE375\\ncinoma, and gastrointestinal tumors \\n• Collagen vascular diseases (9%–20%): systemic lupus erythematosus, \\nrheumatoid arthritis, mixed connective tissue disease, temporal arte-ritis, etc.\\n• Miscellaneous(17%–24%): Drug fever, deep vein thrombosis, pul-monary emboli, sarcoidosis, factitious or fraudulent fever,\\n• Nosocomial FUO – temperature >38.3\\noC, patient hospitalized > \\n24\\xa0hours, but no fever or incubating on admission. Lasting for at least 3 days. Common causes: Clostridium difficile enterocolitis, drug-in-duced, pulmonary embolism, septic thrombophlebitis, sinusitis.\\n• Immune deficient (neutropenic) FUO – Temperature>38.3\\noC, neu-\\ntrophil count ≤ 500 per mm³, lasting for at least 3 days. Common causes: Opportunistic bacterial infections, aspergilosis, candidiasis, herpes virus\\n• HIV – associated – temperature>38.3\\noC, duration of >4 weeks for \\noutpatients, >3 days for inpatients, HIV infection confirmed. Com-mon causes: Cytomegalovirus, Mycobacterium avium intracellulare complex, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, drug – induced, Kaposi’s \\nsarcoma, lymphoma.\\nUncommon causes of FUO:• central fever,\\n• endocrine (hypothalamic dysfunction, hyperthyroidism, pheochro-mocytoma, adrenal insufficiency), infections (dental abscess, Q fever, leptospirosis, psittacosis, tularemia, melioidosis, syphilis, gonococce-mia, chronic meningococcemia, Whipple’s disease, yersiniosis, bru-cellosis),\\n• hereditary periodic fever syndromes (familial Mediterranean fever, PFAPA syndrome (Periodic Fever with Aphthous Stomatitis and Adenitis), \\n• TNFR 1 – associated periodic syndrome, hyper -IgD syndrome, Muckle Wells syndrome, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome), alcoholic hepatitis, hematoma.\\nClinical manifestation include dorsolumbar pain, generalized myalgia, \\narthralgia, anorexia and sleepiness.\\nChills– feeling cold (occurs in most febrile states and is a response of \\nthe nervous system to the „thermoregulation threshold”);\\nFrequently, true chills are observed in the following conditions:• bacteremia of various origins\\n\\n376\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE• sepsis, subacute bacterial endocarditis\\n• bacterial pneumonia\\n• meningococcal meningitis\\n• erysipelas\\n• malaria\\n• acute pyelonephritis\\n• Weil disease\\n• allergic reactions (intravenous drugs, radiograph contrast media, or \\nblood products).\\nChills occur rarely in tuberculosis, paratyphus, typhus, rickettsiosis and \\nviral diseases and never in rheumatic fever. Rigor, piloerection („chicken skin”) associated with teeth chattering, not rarely accompanied by tremor.Skin lesion– a rash or other features: fungal infections, HIV, measles, rubella, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis B virus, usually present with a macu-lopapular rash. Herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster virus present with a vesicular rash, whereas patients with Rickettsiae, yellow fever, viral hem-orrhagic fever, and coxsackie virus may develop a petechial rash. Constitu-tional syndrome is frequently present.\\nDiagnosis. The evaluation of the patient with FUO must be systematic.\\nMedical History. A detailed history and careful physical examination are \\nits cornerstones. The epidemiologic history is especially important. Details about a patient’s background, family medical history, occupations, hobbies, participation in sports, recent travel, international travel (tropical), contacts with animals, insect bites and other injuries, food consumption, previous illnesses, as well as diagnostic and therapeutic interventions, vaccinations, skin rashes, medications, or illicit (intravenous) drug use can provide important information. A systematic interview concerning the functioning of organ systems and comprehensive information about the present condi-tion are likewise important. The social environment of the patient and his or her sexual preferences should also be discussed. Family history of fevers (familial Mediterranean fever), and a complete list of medication used by the patient should be studied.\\nThe following parts of the body are occasionally neglected during phys-\\nical examination: ocular fundus, temporal arteries, nasal sinuses, thyroid gland, renal beds, spinal column, uterine appendages, and prostate gland. Afflictions of these organs are occasionally clinically asymptomatic, which incorrectly leads to the search for a systemic cause of the fever.\\nLaboratory evaluation. Initial studies should include:\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE377\\n• Complete blood count with manual differential, blood smear, eryth-\\nrocyte sedimentation rate;\\n• urinalysis;\\n• biochemical tests;\\n• serologic studies for fungal infections and for connective tissue dis-orders;\\n• examination of the stool for the presence of occult blood;\\n• bacterial cultures of urine, sputum, and blood;\\n• testing of thyroid function;\\n• chest radiography;\\n• electrocardiography,\\n• lumbar puncture.\\n• a tuberculin skin test should also be carried out.\\n• A careful funduscopic examination:which may show choroid tuber-\\ncles suggestive of miliary tuberculosis,\\n• otoscopic test,\\n• genital, and rectal examination should also be performed.\\nThe source of abnormalities detected in one or more of the initial stud-\\nies should be pursued with more specific investigations. If these tests do \\nnot give conclusive results, repeated physical examination and empirical investigations are administreted.\\nImaging studies• bronchoscopy\\n• gastrointestinal endoscopy,\\n• oral cholecystography\\n• Computed tomography scans, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, chest, and abdomen also may be helpful,\\n• ultrasound\\n• lymphangiography or gallium scintigraphy identifies important abnormalities not apparent in other examinations.\\n• Biopsy of the liver, bone marrow, affected lymph nodes or skin may \\nbe indicated for some patients\\nIf these studies fail to yield a diagnosis, the physician has three options:\\n1. The entire evaluation may be repeated in anticipation of the devel-opment of abnormalities on tests that previously showed normal \\nresults;\\n2. a therapeutic trial directed against a probable but unproved diagno-\\nsis (e.g., a ther apeutic trial of isoniazid and rifampin for suspected \\noccult tuberculosis) may be initiated;\\n\\n378\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE3. or the patient may be monitored for new signs or symptoms requir-\\ning further assessment.\\nSpecial entitiesTuberculosis (see Differential diagnosis of pulmonary consolidation)Infective endocarditis. The clinical finding of a heart defect (congeni-\\ntal heart defect 7−16%, postrheumatic valvulopathy – 20−40%) must raise the suspicion of infectious endocarditis in each incidence of fever. How-ever, pathological and anatomical studies indicate that in up to 50% of cases endocarditis is present in normal or degeneratively altered valves. The mitral valve is most often affected, followed by the aortic valve. Incidents of endocarditis affecting the right heart are found in less than 10% of the cases (especially in intravenous drug abuse). Cases of postoperative endo-carditis after heart operations, especially after using a heart−lung machine, endocarditis on artificial valves, and endocarditis in intravenous drug users have increased significantly during recent years.\\nThere are the following categories of endocarditis:• Native valve endocarditis (NVE), acute and subacute\\n• Prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE), early and late\\n• Intravenous drug abuse (IVDA) endocarditis\\n• Other terms commonly used to classify types of IE include pace-maker IE and nosocomial IE (NIE).\\nClinical features and course. Acute endocarditis is rare. Insidious courses \\nare more frequent. A general feeling of malaise, ill-defined limb pain, sub-febrile temperatures, and night sweats are the earliest symptoms. Initially chills are unusual. They occur more frequently later in the course of the disease. Noninfectious endocarditis (Libman−Sacks syndrome in systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatic fever, carcinoid syndrome) occurs without chills.\\nThe alteration in the character of the heart murmur is of decisive, diag-\\nnostic significance in auscultation. Splenomegaly is commonly found in about 30% of advanced cases. Septic microembolisms are of pathogno-monic significance (approximately 30% of the cases), which are predomi-nantly located on the fingers and toes (Osler nodes), palms and soles of the feet ( Janeway lesions), but also in the conjunctivae or subungually. Micro-embolisms can still develop during an adequate antibiotic therapy. Larger embolisms can also cause cerebral deficits. Therefore, it is always neces-sary to consider infectious endocarditis in younger patients experiencing a febrile apoplectic stroke.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE379\\nAcute native valve endocarditis\\n• Frequently involves normal valves and usually has an aggressive course.\\n• It is a rapidly progressive illness in persons who are healthy or debil-itated.\\n• Virulent organisms, such as\\xa0 S aureus\\xa0and group B streptococci, are typ-\\nically the causative agents of this type of endocarditis. Underlying structural valve disease may not be present.\\nSubacute native valve endocarditis• Typically affects only abnormal valves.\\n• Its course, even in untreated patients,\\n• Is usually more indolent than that of the acute form and may extend over many months.\\n• Alpha-hemolytic streptococci or enterococci, usually in the setting of underlying structural valve disease, typically are the causative agents of this type of endocarditis.\\nProsthetic valve endocarditis accounts for 10-20% of cases of IE• Eventually, 5% of mechanical and bioprosthetic valves become infected.\\n• Mechanical valves are more likely to be infected within the first 3 months of implantation, and, after 1 year, bioprosthetic valves are more likely to be infected.\\n• The valves in the mitral valve position are more susceptible than those in the aortic areas\\n• Early PVE occurs within 60 days of valve implantation.\\n• Traditionally, coagulase-negative staphylococci, gram-negative bacilli, \\nand Candida species have been the common infecting organisms.\\n• Late PVE occurs 60 days or more after valve implantation. Staph -\\nylococci, alpha-hemolytic streptococci, and enterococci are the common \\ncausative organisms.\\n• Recent data suggest that S. aureus may now be the most common infecting organism in both early and late PVE\\nIE in drug abusers. In 75% of cases of IVDA IE, no underlying valvular \\nabnormalities are noted, and 50% of these infections involve the tricuspid valve. S. aureus is the most common causative organism.\\nColon carcinomas have frequently been found in patients with Strep-\\ntococcus bovis sepsis. In sterile endocarditis and joint pain, Whipple disease must be considered in the differential diagnosis. The pathogen, Tropheryma\\n\\n380\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEwhippleii, has been detected in valve material by molecular genetic methods. \\nIn fungal endocarditis (drug addicts and after valve replacement), blood cultures usually remain sterile. If an appropriate clinical suspicion exists, the microbiological laboratory must be informed of the tentative diagnosis.\\nTable 31\\nDuke criteria for infective endocarditis\\nMajor criteria Minor criteria\\n• Positive blood culture:\\n• Typical organism in 2 separate cul-tures or\\n• Persistently positive blood cultures (eg. 3>12h (or majority if ≥4)\\n• Endocardium involved;\\n• Positive echocardiogram (vegeta-tion, abscess, dehicence of prosthetic valve) or\\nNew valvular regurgitation (change in \\nmurmur not sufficient• Predisposition (cardiac lesion, IV \\ndrug abuse)\\n• Fever>38ºC• vascular/immunological signs\\n• Positive blood culture that do not meet major criteria\\n• Positive echocardiogram that does not meet the major criteria\\nDefinitive diagnosis is based on:\\n2 major criteria or\\n1 major and 3 minor criteria or\\nAll 5 minor criteria (if no major criteria are met)Laboratory tests and imagistic investigation:\\n• As in sepsis, blood cultures are of decisive importance in making the \\ndiagnosis.\\n• transesophageal (endoscopic) echocardiography is significantly bet-\\nter than that of the transthoracic examination echocardiography \\nbecause it cannot exclude endocarditis with certainty. The detection of persistent outgrowths on the aortic or mitral valve or a subvalvular \\nabscess in echocardiography is diagnostically and prognostically sig-\\nnificant and supports the indication for surgical valve replacement.\\n• The blood cell count, with a moderate leukocytosis and a distinct left shift, is usually toxically altered.\\n• Urinalysis– Focal glomerulonephritis occurs in approximately 50% \\nof endocarditis cases and is characterized by erythrocyturia, cilindru-\\nria, and proteinuria.\\nHereditary Febrile Syndromes\\nHyper-IgD Syndrome The hyper-IgD syndrome has a clinical picture \\nthat is similar to that of familial Mediterranean fever. Starting in newborns\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE381\\nor infants, fever attacks develop, lasting three to seven (maximally 14) days \\nand recur at intervals of four to eight weeks. The fever is accompanied by lymph node enlargement, splenomegaly (50%), arthralgia or arthritis, \\nabdominal pain, peritonitis with secondary adhesions, and erythematous \\nskin alterations. In addition to leukocytosis and elevated ESR, repeated, elevated IgD values are crucial to the diagnosis (possibly combined with elevated IgA). A mutation of mevalonate kinase has been confirmed. This leads to a slight reduction of serum cholesterol and elevated mevalonic acid concentration in the urine. The relationship of the mevalonate kinase \\nmutation to the elevated IgD value and inflammation is unclear. Differen-\\ntial diagnosis of hereditory febrile syndrome are shown in Table 32. Ele-vated IgD values can also be found in chronic infections (HIV, tuberculo-sis), aspergillosis, sarcoidosis, lymphomas, and in smokers.\\nFamilial Mediterranean fever. This is an autosomal recessive disease \\nwhich is caused by a mutation in the pyrin gene. The disease has primarily been described in Jewish, Armenian, Turkish, and Arab populations and \\noccurs throughout the Mediterranean region\\nTable 33\\nDiagnostic criteria for familial Mediterranean fever\\nMajor criteria Minor criteria\\nTypical attacks:\\nPeritonitis (generalised)\\nPleuritis (unilateral) or \\npericarditis\\nMonoarthritis (hip, knee, \\nankle).1-3 incomplete attacks involving 1 or more of the \\nfollowing sites:\\n- Abdomen- Chest- Joint- Exertional leg pain- Favourable response to colchicine.- Supportive criteria- Family history of familial Mediterranean fever- Appropriate ethnic origin- Age <20 years at disease onset\\nThe requirements for the diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever are \\n≥1 major criterion, or ≥2 minor criteria, or 1 minor criterion plus ≥5 sup-portive criteria, or 1 minor criterion plus ≥4 of the first 5 supportive criteria.\\nFeatures of attacks: typical attacks are defined as recurrent (≥3 of the \\nsame type), febrile (rectal temperature of 38°C (100°F) or higher), and short (lasting between 12 hours and 3 days). Incomplete attacks are defined as painful and recurrent, differing from typical attacks in 1 or 2 features, as follows:\\n\\n382\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE• The temperature is normal or lower than 38°C (100°F)\\n• The attacks are longer or shorter than specified (but not shorter than \\n6 hours or longer than a week); may be severe, requiring bed rest or spontaneous remission/ symptom-free interval.\\n• No signs of peritonitis are recorded during the abdominal attacks. The abdominal attacks are localized.\\n• Arthritis is in joints other than those specified above. Attacks are not counted if they do not fit the definition of either typical or incom-plete attacks.\\nDiagnosis.• Transient inflammatory response, with 1 or more abnormal test result(s) for WBC count,\\n• C-reactive protein,\\n• Erythrocyte sedimentation rate,\\n• Serum amyloid A,\\n• Fibrinogen,\\n• Episodic proteinuria/haematuria,\\n• Unproductive laparotomy or removal of „white” appendix.\\n• Consanguinity of parents.\\nTumor Necrosis Factor Receptor-associated Periodic Fever Syndrome \\n(TRAPS) The autosomally dominant inherited mutations in the tumor necro-sis factor receptor 1 gene (especially observed in Ireland and Scotland) exhibit are current fever that lasts for one to two (maximally 10) days, notably severe myalgia, abdominal pain with possible diarrhea periorbital facial edemas with conjunctivitis, exanthema, pleuritis, and arthralgia. The CRP and leukocyte values in the serum are elevated and the soluble TNF receptor 1 is reduced.\\nTable 32\\nDifferential diagnosis of familial Mediterranean fever (FMF),  \\nhyper-immunoglobulinemia D syndrome (HIDS), and tumor necrosis factor \\n(TNF) receptor-associated periodic fever (TRAPS)\\nFMF HIDS TRAPS\\nMutation pyrin gene mevalonate kinase \\ngeneTNF receptor 1 gene\\nMode of inher-itanceautosomal re-cessiveautosomal dom-inantautosomal dominant\\nAge at time of first clinical manifesta-tions(years)<20 <1 <20\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE383\\nAttack duration of \\nfever0.5−3 days 3−7 (maximally 14) days1−2 (maximally 10) days\\nClinical manifesta-tionssterile pleuritis, peritonitis, ar-thritisLymphadenop-athy, arthritis, peritonitis, macu-lo-papular rashMyalgia, periorbital edema, pleuritis, arthralgia\\nLaboratory findings leukocytosis, CRP ↑leukocytosis, CRP ↑ IgD ↑ \\n(possibly IgA ↑)leukocytosis CRP ↑soluble TNF re-ceptor 1 ↓\\nPeriodic Fever. This term refers to fever attacks of one to four days dura-\\ntion, which occur over a period of years at more or less regular intervals.\\nClinical Features. While the rise in temperature is the obligatory symp-\\ntom, the secondary symptoms (arthralgia, myalgia, impairment of general \\nhealth) can vary.\\nDiagnosis. In addition to fever the objective parameters that can be \\ndetermined are elevated ESR, CRP , moderate leukocytosis with left shift, rarely joint swelling, skin manifestations, as well as acute abdomen. After excluding infectious and neoplastic diseases as well as collagenosis, recur-rent fever attacks over a period of years lead to the consideration of several clinical pictures.\\nMuckle-Wells syndrome. Muckle–Wells syndrome (MWS), also \\nknown as\\xa0urticaria-deafness-amyloidosis syndrome\\xa0(UDA),\\xa0is a\\xa0rare\\xa0auto-somal dominant\\xa0 disease which causes\\xa0 sensorineural deafness\\xa0 and recur-rent\\xa0hives, and can lead to amyloidosis. Individuals with MWS often have episodic fever, chills, and joint pain. As a result, MWS is considered a type of\\xa0periodic fever syndrome. MWS is caused by a defect in the\\xa0CIAS1\\xa0gene which creates the protein\\xa0cryopyrin. MWS is closely related to two other syndromes,\\xa0familial cold urticaria\\xa0and\\xa0neonatal onset multisystem inflam-matory disease. In fact, all three are related to mutations in the same gene and subsumed under the term\\xa0 cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). Signs and symptoms: sensorineural deafness, recurrent\\xa0 urticaria, \\nfevers, chills, arthralgia.\\nPeriodic Fever, Adenitis, Pharyngitis, and Aphthous stomatitis \\n(„PFAPA”) Syndrome. The etiologically unexplained „PFAPA” syndrome (periodic fever, adenitis, pharyngitis, and aphthous stomatitis) can cause long-lasting, periodic fever in infants. The attacks, which last for three to five days, are partially to occur in hyperthyroidism, namely when an under-lying case of subacute thyroiditis is present. In thyrotoxic crises the fever\\n\\n384\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEincreases to over 40°C. Fever is also a frequent symptom in an Addisonian \\ncrisis. This must especially be considered when discontinuing long-term steroid therapy. In contrast other steroids (e.g., progesterone) are them-selves pyrogenic. Individual patients with pheochromocytoma also exhibit elevated temperatures. The rare combination of hyperglycemia and fever is also attributed to elevated catecholamines. It is also worth mentioning cases of hyperthermia in acute hyperparathyroidism with extremely high calcium values. These are due to lesions near the thermoregulation center of the hypothalamus.\\nFever in V egetative Dystonia. The differentiation between hyperthyroid \\nrises in temperature and vegetatively caused febrile conditions is often very difficult, because the symptoms frequently overlap. However, the specific hyperthyroid symptoms such as fine tremor, constant resting tachycardia, warm moist skin, ocular symptoms, and struma do not belong to vegetative dystonia. In doubtful cases, determination of thyroid gland hormone values can facilitate a differentiation.\\nFever in tumors. In some tumors, unexplained febrile states remain in \\nthe foreground of the clinical presentation for a long period of time. These rises in temperature are already present at an early stage, and therefore, can hardly be explained by tumor lysis. Mainly hypernephroma and car-cinomas of the pancreas, liver, and stomach that are associated with fever prevailamong solid tumors. In bronchial carcinoma the tumor itself, as well as secondary pneumonic processes can cause fever. An additional cause is atrial myxoma (changing findings on auscultation, recurrent embolisms, joint pain). Tumors of the lymphoreticular system, such as malignant lym-phomas or leukemias, frequently cause recurrent febrile states. In 5−10% of patients with lymphogranuloma a characteristic periodic type of fever (Pel−Ebstein) is observed. In Hodgkin disease and non-Hodgkin lymphoma A-symptoms are present if general symptoms are absent. B-symptoms are present if a weight loss of more than 10% within a six-month period and/or an inexplicable fever of more than 38°C and/or night sweats are observed. Pruritus and alcoholic pain do not count as B-symptoms.\\nFever in the elderly. There may be different causes of fever, but we should \\nexclude first of all malignancies – such as chronic leukemias, lymphomas, renal cell carcinomas, and metastatic cancers. Collagenvascular disease (polymyalgia rheumatica, vasculitis) and infections should also be excluded.\\nFever in Tissue Degradation. Frequent causes of fever include: myo-\\ncardial infarction, pulmonary infarction, renal infarction, gangrene of the\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE385\\nextremities, pancreatitis, cirrhosis of the liver, hematoma in the resorption \\nstage in body cavities or in the gastrointestinal tract, or intracranial hem-orrhages. However, in these cases it is virtually always the primary clinical event and not the fever which is in the foreground.\\nSweet syndrome includes acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis, throm-\\nbosis, tubulo-interstitial nephritis and uveitis syndrome (TINU).\\nThermoregulatory disorders. It is necessary to differentiate the follow-\\ning conditions:\\n• Central brain tumor,\\n• cerebrovascular accident,\\n• encephalitis\\n• hypothalamic dysfunction,\\n• anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia,\\n• exercise-induced hyperthermia,\\n• hyperthyroidism,\\n• pheochromocytoma\\nUrticaria. Urticarial skin lesions occur frequently and can be associ-\\nated with infections caused by mycoplasma, enteroviruses, adenoviruses, Epstein−Barr virus, HIV, and hepatitis viruses, as well as febrile, noninfec-tious systemic diseases (allergy, vasculitis, malignancy).\\nFever in allergic reactions. In this group drug fever is of greatest sig-\\nnificance. Nearly all medications can cause fever if the patient is hyper-sensitive. Sometimes (but not obligatorily) this fever reaction is accom-panied by skin manifestations, which make the diagnosis easier. The drug eruptions exhibitan extremely varied morphology. The most frequently occurring are maculopapular exanthemas and urticaria. Scarlatiniform (e.g., quinine), morbilliform (e.g., barbiturates), bullous, eczematous, and purpuralike exanthemas also occur. A febrile erythema nodosum or a Ste-vens−Johnson syndrome is observed after taking diphenylhydantoin or sul-fonamides. In drug fever, eosinophils are usually present in the peripheral blood, but eosinophilia exists only in approximately 20% of the cases. The ESR or CRP values can be significantly elevated and often leukocytosis and slightly elevated transaminase levels are also present. One to two days after discontinuing the responsible medication, the fever generally can be expected to remit. A renewed exposure to the responsible medication can possibly cause an anaphylactic reaction.\\nDrug fever. Many drugs have the capacity to induce fever as an adverse \\nreaction. Such fever may be the result of a pharmacologic effect of the drug,\\n\\n386\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEan idiosyncratic reaction, or a complication related to drug administration \\n(phlebitis, chemical meningitis, sterile abscess). If fevers due to complica-tions of drug administration are excluded, it is apparent that certain drugs, such as a-methyldopa, quinidine, and the penicillins, are more likely causes of the disorder than others, such as the aminoglycoside antibiotics and car-diac glycosides. Although the list of drugs capable of inducing fever is long, the list of agents that actually cause the disorder is considerably shorter. Important former causes of drug fever, such as laxatives, bromides, arsenical agents, and vancomycin, are now rarely incriminated in the disorder, either because they are no longer used or because new drug preparations are less pyrogenic (e.g., vancomycin).\\nImmunodeficiency– and human immunodeficiency virus–associ-\\nated fever of unknown origin. HIV-associated FUO is defined as recur-rent fevers over a four-week period in an outpatient or for three days in a hospitalized patient with HIV infection. Although acute HIV infection remains an important cause of classic FUO, the virus also makes patients susceptible to opportunistic infections. The differential diagnosis of FUO in patients who are HIV positive includes infectious etiologies such as Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare complex, Pneumocystis jirovecii, pneu-monia, Cytomegalovirus and fungi (Histoplasma capsulatum, Cryptococcus \\nneoformans, and Coccidioides immitis). Malignancies such as Kaposi sarcoma and primary brain lymphoma should also be entertained. Geographic con-siderations are also important.\\nHemophagocytosis syndrome. Hemophagocytosis syndrome (also \\ncalled hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) is a rare, but often very severe, multiorgan disease with a high mortality rate. It is associated with malignant or autoimmune diseases or can develop after activation of mac-rophages (probably infection related). The clinical picture is associated with a great variety of microorganisms, but most frequently with Epstein−Barr, cytomegalovirus infection, hepatitis, or HIV infections. In the bone mar-row and other lymphoepithelial tissues an increased number of histiocytes phagocytose erythrocytes, leukocytes, and thrombocytes are detected. Histiocytes and other blood cells are morphologically mature. The clini-cal presentation is characterized by fever, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, jaundice, and sometimes exanthema or neuropsychological deficits. The cardinal symptom is pancytopenia and there is often a massive elevation of the ferritin value, an intravascular coagulation disorder, and hepatic dysfunction.'),\n",

Syndrome of pulmonary consolidation (infiltrate) \\nrepresents a sum of symptoms and signs caused by loss of alveolar air and \\nlocalized decrease of lung elasticity.\\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGYThe loss of alveolar air commonly happens due to:1. Substitution with• Inflammatory infiltrate (infection, e.g. pneumonia)\\n• Tumour tissue (cancer)\\n• Blood (pulmonary embolism, diffuse alveolar haemorrhage)\\n• Connective tissue (idiopathic or secondary pulmonary fibrosis)\\n• Parasite invasion (hydatic cyst)\\n2. Atelectasis (segmental, lobar).\\nThe signs of pulmonary consolidation include dyspnoe, tachypnoe, \\noccasionally cyanosis and delay of the affected part of chest during breath-ing. If a large enough segment of parenchyma is involved, it can alter the transmission of air and sound. In the presence of consolidation, vocal fre-mitus becomes more pronounced on chest palpation. Localized subdull or dull percussion sound is commonly found on percussion. On chest auscul-tation localized pathological bronchial sound or decreased vesicular mur-mur with crackles or locally decreased vesicular murmur can be revealed.\\nRadiologic signs of lung consolidationPulmonary opacities are characterized by their size, pattern and distri-\\nbution.\\nBased on their size and extension, localized opacities (such as those \\nfound in lobar pneumonia or tuberculoma) are differentiated from diffuse opacities (such as those found in pulmonary edema, diffuse alveolar haem-orrhage).\\nWith regard to the pattern of infiltrates, infiltrates may occur with an \\nacinar (alveolar) or interstitial pattern. Acinar (alveolar) infiltrates have the \\nfollowing characteristics: homogeneous density, tendency for confluence (Felson sign), air bronchograms and absence of lung volume loss. Inter-stitial infiltrates have the following characteristics: ground-glass opacity, \\ninhomogeneous density, linear and reticular densities (Kerley A, B, and C lines), nodules, „honey combing” and loss of lung volume.\\n\\n98\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEThe list of diseases for the differential diagnosis of lung consolida-\\ntion includes:\\nCommon diseases\\n• Pneumonia\\n• Tuberculosis\\n• Malignancy (lung cancer, metastases)\\n• Lung abcess\\n• Pulmonary infarction due to pulmonary embolism\\n• Congestive heart failure (pulmonary edema)\\nLess common diseases• Drug-induced lung disease\\n• Eosinophylic pneumonia\\n• Radiation pneumonitis\\n• Aspergillosis\\n• Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia\\n• Diffuse alveolar haemorrhage syndromes\\n• Atelectasis\\nPneumonia. It is the most frequent cause of lung consolidation and \\nrepresents an acute exsudative alveolitis of various infectious origin (bac-terial, viral, fungal, protozoal) and of various setting (community-acquired, \\nhospital-acquired, due to aspiration and in immunocompromised host). The clinical presentation of pneumonia usually starts with sudden onset, high fever, chills, dyspnoe, pleuritic chest pain, cough with or without spu-tum, tachycardia, and hypotension. Physical findings include: cyanosis, localized increased vocal fremitus, dullness on percussion, and bronchial breath sounds, end-inspiratory rales on auscultation.\\nGeneral blood analysis reveals leukocytosis with pronounced left \\nshift, lymphopenia (especially in viral pneumonia) and elevated erythro-cyte sedimentation rate. Microscopic examination of the sputum reveals Gram-positive or Gram-negative microorganisms. Abundant amounts of Gram-positive diplococci identified in sputum are diagnostic for Strepto-coccus pneumoniae. Sputum culture allows to diagnoze the causative path-ogen of pneumonia and its in vitro sensitivity to antibacterials in case if the titer of microorganism is more than 10\\n6. In hospitalized patients blood \\ncultures are positive in one-fourth of cases, especially in severe pneumonia. Cultures from pleural effusion are positive in case of complicated pneumo-nia (pleural empyema). A rapid urinary antigen test (immunochromato-graphic test) can be performed to detect Legionella bacteria or Streptococ-\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE99\\ncus pneumoniae antigen (performed mostly in intensive care unit). Reverse \\ntranscription polymerase chain reaction test (RT-PCR) detects respiratory viruses, Chlamydophila spp., Mycoplasma pneumonia, Legionella pneumophila \\nin nasopharyngeal secretion samples and blood. The serologic assay show-ing increase of IgM 2-4 weeks after pneumonia onset is useful in case of Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psitaci, Mycoplasma pneumo-\\nnia, Legionella pneumophila and protozoal pneumonia. Induced sputum or biopsy (e.g., transbronchial) and subsequent histopathologic demonstration of organism is necessary for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis jiroveci or other fungi, e.g., Aspergillus spp. C-reactive protein is increased (more than 6 mg/\\nml) and procalcitonin is usually higher than 2 ng/l in severe pneumonia.\\nArterial blood gases examination reveals hypoxia, hypercapnia, respira-\\ntory acidosis. On the chest radiograph the infiltrates are dense, homoge-neous, and clearly delineated with air bronchograms. Chest computered tomography is indicated in slowly/nonresolving pneumonia or in a rapid deterioration of patients condition. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and biopsy are usefull in case of suspicion of endobronchial tumor and subsequent retrostenotic pneumonia, for obtaining aspirates to diagnose respira-tory pathogens (especially in case of immunocompromised patients), for obtaining bronchoalveolar lavages (in case of suspicion of noninfectious origin of infiltrate, e.g., interstitial pneumopathies, sarcoidosis). Fiberop-tic bronchoscopy with endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) is necessary for transbronchial biopsy of lung tissue (e.g., neoplasia, idiopatic or second-ary interstitial pneumopaties). It is important to mention that there is a positive clinical response and radiological resorption of pneumonia under antibacterial treatment. The resolution of infiltrates takes place within 4 to 8 weeks. Delayed resorption of infiltrates may indicate several possible conditions: 1) another diagnosis (e.g., tuberculosis, neoplasia, interstitial pneumonitis), 2) a complication (lung abcess), 3) a resistant microorgan-ism (e.g., meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus), 4) patients comorbities \\n(alcohol abuse, diabetes mellitus, chronic obstructive airway disease etc.).\\nTuberculosis. Patients` epidemiological anamnesis may be consistent \\nwith risk factors for pulmonary tuberculosis:\\n• history of known close contact with someone who has active tuber -\\nculosis;\\n• immunocompromised status (e.g., those with an HIV infection, cancer, transplanted organs, and prolonged high-dose corticosteroid therapy);\\n\\n100\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE• substance abuse (intravenous or injection drug users and alcoholics); \\n• presence of comorbodities (e.g., diabetes mellitus, chronic renal fail -\\nure, malnourishment, hemodialysis, or transplanted organ);\\n• any person without an adequate health care (e.g., the homeless); \\ninstitutionalization (e.g., long-term care facilities, psychiatric institu -\\ntions, prisons);\\n• a health care worker performing high-risk activities (administration of aerosolized pentamidine and other medications, sputum induction \\nprocedures, bronchoscopy, suctioning, coughing procedures, caring for the immunosuppressed patient and administering anesthesia and \\nrelated procedures (e.g., intubation, suctioning).\\nPatients complain of subfebrile temperature, general malaise, weight \\nloss, prolonged cough (more than 3 weeks), night sweats, blood streaked sputum, hemoptysis, regional lymphadenitis, and rarely erythema nodo-\\nsum. There is a discrepancy between the lack of findings on chest examina-tion and the presence of opacity on chest X-ray.\\nIn active pulmonary TB chest X-ray findings usually include upper lobe \\ninfiltrates or cavitary lesions, although other pattern and localization may \\nbe seen. There is a non-resolving lung infiltrate under a nonspecific antibac -\\nterial treatment, or a recurrent infiltrate (an infiltrate that reappears after a \\ndiscontinuation of fluoroquinolone therapy of pneumonia). Sputum, fluid, \\nor biopsy of the involved tissue should be sent for appropriate stains (acid-\\nfast, fluorescent and auramine-rhodamine) and cultures. The sputum should \\nbe obtained early in the morning and a minimum of 3 separate samples \\nshould be taken. Bronchoscopy with a bronchial lavage and biopsy may be required if the sputum fails to yield the diagnosis. Fine-needle aspiration \\nof an affected area may reveal epithelioid cells and granuloma, but acid-fast \\nbacillus (AFB) stains are frequently negative. Mycobacterial culture (gold standard) requires only 10 to 100 organisms to produce a positive result, \\nand thus cultures can be revealing even in the presence of a negative smear. \\nGenetic tests are able to confirm rapidly the presence of Mycobacterium \\ntuberculosis (ex., GeneExpert MTB). In the presence of adenopathy, a lymph \\nnode biopsy should be considered as it may reveal caseating granulomas, positive acid-fast smears, and positive cultures. A purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test is useful in screening for prior mycobacterial infection.\\nLung cancer. There are two types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer \\n(SCLC) and non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). NSCLC accounts for \\napproximately 85% of all lung cancers. The three main cell types of NSCLC \\nare squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and large-cell carcinoma.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE101\\nAdenocarcinomas and large-cell cancers are predominantly peripheral, and \\nsquamous cell carcinomas are central tumors.\\nIn patients with lung cancer the clinical symptoms and signs result \\nfrom: 1) the local tumor growth, 2) tumor metastasis, and 3) paraneoplastic syndromes.\\n1. Clinical manifestations of lung cancer caused by local tumor growth \\nand intrathoracic spread include cough, dyspnoe, chest pain, prolonged sub-febrile fever, hemoptysis, loss of weight and retrostenotic recurrent pneumo-\\nnia. Vocal cord paralysis and superior vena cava syndrome are the symptoms \\nof locally advanced disease. The presence of Pancoast syndrome typically \\nresults when a malignant neoplasm of the superior sulcus of the lung leads \\nto destructive lesions of the thoracic inlet and the involvement of the bra-chial plexus and cervical sympathetic nerves accompanied by the following: \\nsevere pain in the shoulder region radiating toward the axilla and scapula, \\nwith later extension along the ulnar aspect of the arm to the hand, atrophy of hand and arm muscles, Horner syndrome (ptosis, miosis, hemianhidrosis, \\nenophthalmos) and compression of the blood vessels with edema.\\n2. The most common sites of metastases are mediastinal lymph nodes, \\npleura, bones, liver, adrenal glands and brain. The signs and symptoms \\nresulting from CNS involvement range from headaches or mental status changes to focal or generalized seizures.\\n3. The major categories of paraneoplastic syndromes include endocrine, \\nneurologic, and cutaneous manifestations. In patients with lung cancer the \\nmost common paraneoplastic syndrome is the syndrome of inappropriate \\nsecretion of antidiuretic hormone, most frequently reported in patients with SCLC and manifesting as hyponatremia (<130 mmol/l). Humoral hyper\\n-\\ncalcemia of malignancy results from the secretion of a parathyroid hormone (PTH)-related protein. Eaton-Lambert syndrome (from SCLC) is a pseu\\n-\\ndomyasthenic syndrome, which presents with proximal limb muscle weakness and fatigue. Hypertrophic pulmonary osteoarthropathy is characterized by \\nthe formation of new periosteal bone in the digits and clubbing of the digits.\\nPhysical examination may reveal loss of weight, pale skin, cyanosis \\n(advanced stage), axillary, cervical, supraclavicular, and scalene regions lym-phadenopathy. The signs of airway obstruction (localized dry rales) or pleu-\\nral effusion (localized dullness on percussion, no transmission of vesicular \\nmurmur) and hepatomegaly can be found additionally to physical findings of lung consolidation.\\nChest radiograph can present as a mass, peripheral nodule, hilar or \\nmediastinal changes, pleural effusions, or metastatic disease. Previous chest\\n\\n102\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEX-rays are needed to see the temporal progression of the lesions (a nodule \\nthat is stable over a period of 2 years is unlikely to be malignant). Chest X-ray may reveal areas of atelectasis which suggest an endobronchial growth of cancer. Computed tomography offers better visualization of the nodule and more sensitive detection of mediastinal lymph node involvement and it can also help identify local invasion of the chest wall and pleura. Positron emission tomography (PET) is a useful to complete the staging workup in patients with recently diagnosed NSCLC. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest is helpful in the setting of suspected spinal cord, vascu-lar, or chest wall involvement. Sputum cytologic examination is most useful in patients with centrally located tumors. Flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy is helpful in determining the endobronchial extent of disease and biopsy, brushings and bronchioloalveolar lavage. Endobronchial ultrasound is used to biopsy some of the mediastinal lymph nodes and left-sided lesions.\\nBoth Hodgkin’s and Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and metastatic can-\\ncer (malignant melanoma, adenocarcinoma of the breast or gastrointes-tinal tract, or Kaposi’s sarcoma) can present with pulmonary involvement. Loss of weight and/or hilar, mediastinal or peripheral adenopathy should prompt further investigation. Fibreoptic bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy are necessary for the diagnosis.\\nLung abscess is defined as necrosis of the pulmonary tissue and for-\\nmation of cavities containing necrotic debris or fluid caused by microbial infection. The suspicion for lung abcess should be raised in case of persis-tence of high fever in pneumonia treated with antibacterials, especially in immunocompromised host and in alcohol abuse. The formation of multiple small (<2 cm) abscesses is occasionally referred to as necrotizing pneu-monia. Both lung abscess and necrotizing pneumonia are manifestations of a similar pathologic process. The usual symptoms are fever, cough with sputum production, night sweats, anorexia, and weight loss. The expecto-rated sputum characteristically is foul smelling and bad tasting. Patients may develop hemoptysis or pleurisy. Physical examination findings of a patient with lung abscess are variable: temperatures higher than 38.5°C, patients have evidence of gingivitis and/or periodontal disease and digital clubbing. Clinical findings of concomitant consolidation (e.g., decreased breath sounds, dullness to percussion, bronchial breath sounds, inspiratory crackles) may be present. Dullness on percussion, contralateral shift of the mediastinum, and absent breath sounds over the effusion are associated with pleural effusion, empyema, and pyopneumothorax.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE103\\nConfirmatory laboratory and instrumental findings include:\\n• general blood analysis (leukocytosis, anemia, elevated erhythrocyte sedimentation rate);\\n• chest X-ray (opacity with central cavitation);\\n• sputum gram`s stain (1 predominant gram-positive or -negative organism and neutrophils in aerobic infections;\\n• mixed flora with many neutrophils in anaerobic infections);\\n• sputum culture (growth of normal respiratory flora in polymicrobial etiology);\\n• blood culture (positive for infecting organism in aerobic infection); \\n• empyema fluid culture (may be negative in polymicrobial anaerobic infections;\\n• growth of infecting organism in aerobic infections);\\n• CT chest (thick-walled, usually round cavity with irregular margins forming an acute angle with chest wall, no signs of compression of surrounding lung);\\n• bronchoscopy (proximal airway obstruction by a tumour or foreign body);\\n• quantitative cultures of protected specimen brushings (> 1000 colo-ny-forming units/ml of fluid);\\n• quantitative cultures of protected bronchoalveolar lavage samples (> 10 000 or 100 000 colony-forming units/ml);\\n• percutaneous needle aspiration and culture (growth of infecting organism);\\n• sputum cytology (malignant cells in underlying malignancy);\\n• lung ultrasound (hypoechoic lesion with irregular outer wall and cavity appearing as a hyperechoic ring);\\n• echocardiogram (vegetations on the affected valve in bacterial endo-carditis);\\n• chest angioCT (intraluminal filling defects in pulmonary embo-lism).\\nPulmonary infarction due to pulmonary embolism. Infarction pneu-\\nmonia corresponds to secondary infection of pulmonary infarction. The cause of pulmonary embolization, including the source of the emboli (e. g., deep vein thrombosis in the lower extremities, myxoma of the right atrium) and risk factors for thrombosis (immobility, recent surgery, neo-plasms) should always be taken into consideration.\\nThe following signs are consistent with infarction pneumonia: rapid\\n\\n104\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEdeterioration of general condition, persisting fever and tachycardia, sud-\\nden dyspnea associated with a feeling of oppression, tachycardia, pleuritic chest pain, purulent sputum, with or without hemoptysis, progressive leu-kocytosis, a cavitation of the pulmonary infiltrate, an accentuated second pulmonary heart sound, and gallop rhythm. Extensive pulmonary emboli may cause hypotension and cyanosis. As the chest wall excursions on the corresponding side may be reduced, rales and pleural rub may not be pro-nounced or appear only later in the course of the disease.\\nThe levels of blood bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), ALAT, \\nASAT may be elevated due to right-sided heart failure with congestion of the liver. Serum D-dimer (a product of fibrin degradation) is increased. ECG may reveal right branch block, S1Q3T3, sinusal tachycardia, parox-ysm of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Pulmonary function tests reveal a restrictive ventilatory defect and reduced diffusing capacity. Arterial blood gas analysis shows hypoxemia and respiratory alkalosis (due to hyperven-tilation). A typical wedge-shaped infiltrate extending from the hilum to the chest wall with or without pleural effusion is not always seen and the infiltrates may be similar to pneumonia of other origin. Echocardiography demonstrates increased systolic pressure in the pulmonary artery, dilatation of the right atrium and ventricle. Spiral-angio-CT demonstrates the intra-vascular emboli and confirms the diagnosis.\\nCongestive heart failure. Patients may have cough with mucous or \\npink sputum, dyspnoe, ortopnoe, acrocyanosis, pitting peripheral edema. The anamnesis is consistent with chronic cardiovascular disease and factors leading to heart failure (e.g., acute myocardial infarction, hypertensive cri-sis, arrhythmias etc.). Auscultation reveals predominantly basal pulmonary rales. Chest X-ray shows localized unilateral or bilateral reticular infiltrates due to pulmonary interstitial edema, cardiomegaly, redistribution of the \\npulmonary circulation from predominantly lower zones to lower and upper zones, increased caliber of pulmonary veins, Kerley A and B lines, and right-sided or bilateral pleural effusions. There is a rapid radiological reso-lution of infiltrates (48-72 hours) following the treatment of heart failure, diuretics inclusively. Sputum examination with Berlin blue staining reveals hemosiderine-containing macrophages. There are elevated levels of seric BNP (brain natriuretic peptide), decreased ejection fraction and dilated cardiac cavities on echocardiography, and changes on ECG (e.g., ST eleva-tion in acute myocardial infarction).\\nDrug-induced pneumonitis. A number of drugs (e.g., amiodarone,\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE105\\nmethotrexate, bleomycin) can cause pulmonary consolidation. Illicit drugs \\nassociated with pulmonary disease include heroin (smoked or injected) and crack cocaine. Fever, nonproductive cough and dyspnoe are the usual pres-entation of drug-induced pneumonitis and occur within weeks or months of initiating therapy/illicit drug use. Chest radiograph abnormalities may be absent early on but infiltrates usually develop and may localize to mimic pneumonia. A detailed drug history should be obtained from all patients and/or their relatives at presentation. High-resolution CT scan of the chest and fibreoptic bronchoscopy are helpful to exclude the possibility of an infectious or other non-infectious aetiology as an alternative diagnosis. Drug-induced infiltrate is commonly resolved after the discontinuation of the drug and corticosteroid administration.\\nEosinophilic pneumonia. Acute eosinophilic pneumonia usually presents \\nwith an acute history of nonproductive cough, dyspnoea, and fever. Dif-fuse parenchymal opacities, rather than localized consolidation, are typi-cally seen on chest radiograph. Initial full blood count shows a neutrophilic leucocytosis but patients with severe progressive disease may develop an eosinophilia. Diagnosis is made by fiberoptic bronchoscopy with bron-chioalveolar lavage demonstrating a significant eosinophilia. The patients develop progressive respiratory failure without treatment. The treatment with glucocorticoids results in rapid improvement.\\nTransient eosinophilic pulmonary infiltrates (Löffler). Transient eosino-\\nphilic pulmonary infiltrates may be due to larvae of three types of worms passing the pulmonary vessels on their way to the gastrointestinal tract: Ascaris lumbricoides, hook worms, and Strongyloides stercoralis. Patients com-\\nplain of nonproductive cough and general malaise. The radiologic infiltrates are typically transient and disappear over the course of approximately two weeks. Blood eosinophilia varies between 7−70%. The total leukocyte count is not significantly elevated. Maximal eosinophilia lags a few days behind the pulmonary infiltrates. As transient pulmonary infiltrates are most com-monly caused by Ascaris infection, these eggs may be identified in stools, \\nand not at the time of the pulmonary infiltrates but about two months later.\\nRadiation pneumonitis. It occurs after radiation therapy of cancers of \\nthe breast, lungs, esophagus, and mediastinum (thymoma, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphoma). Radiation therapy of breast or lung cancer leads to alterations in the chest radiograph in about one-third of patients, and in 10% of patients it causes clinical symptoms. Radiation pneumonitis is observed between one and six months after the end of treatment. It is asso-\\n\\n106\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEciated with a slowly progressive cough, fever, and dyspnea. After duration \\nof up to one month, spontaneous restitution usually occurs. Radiation ther-\\napy of breast cancer may cause bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneu-\\nmonia (BOOP), a syndrome associated with dyspnea, fatigue, and varying \\nunilateral and bilateral infiltrates. Pulmonary function tests reveal a restric-tive ventilatory defect and reduced diffusing capacity. The chest radiograph shows focal or confluent, patchy or reticular infiltrates.\\nAspergillosis. Aspergillosis is the most common invasive mold infec-\\ntion and is caused by Aspergillus spp. The main route of infection is inhala-\\ntion of spores which colonize the lungs, nose, and paranasal sinuses. Asper -\\ngillus spp. cause disease in humans by tissue invasion, colonization, and \\nsubsequent allergic reaction (allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis); and \\ncolonization of preexisting cavities (fungus ball or aspergilloma).\\nThe main risk factors that promote invasive aspergillosis are: prolonged \\nand profound neutropenia (< 500 x 10\\n9/l) especially in bone marrow trans-\\nplant recipients; high dose corticosteroid therapy; broad-spectrum antibi-otic therapy; chronic granulomatous disease; acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with CD4 counts <50 cells/mm\\n3; and treatment with \\nimmunosuppressive agents.\\nInvasive aspergillosis with pulmonary involvement may present as acute \\nbronchopneumonia with symptoms like dyspnoe, cough, hemoptysis, fever and cavitation on imaging, or slowly progressive bronchopneumonia. Inva-sive aspergillosis may also present with extrapulmonary involvement of the central nervous system, heart, bone, or skin. Peripheral blood eosinophilia, and elevated serum IgE levels, antiAspergillus IgM, IgG can be revealed. The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis is ideally established based on a combination of culture results and histologic proof of tissue invasion. Ex juvantibus criteria include positive clinical and radiological response to the treatment with voriconazole, amphotericin B, or caspofungin.\\nCryptogenic organizing pneumonia. Cryptogenic organizing pneu-\\nmonia (COP) is the idiopathic form of organizing pneumonia and is from the group of idiopathic interstitial lung diseases. Patients are usually in their fifties or sixties and present with dyspnoea, cough and fever. The chest radiograph features of COP are typically bilateral with areas of patchy or diffuse consolidation or ground glass infiltrates. It is necessary to exclude known causes of COP such as drugs and rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus). The diagnosis requires high reso-lution chest computered tomography, transbronchial lung biopsy and sub-\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE107\\nsequent histology or video-assisted thoracoscopy with biopsy. Ex juvanti-\\nbus criterion: treatment with glucocorticoids usually results in clinical and radiological improvement.\\nDiffuse alveolar haemorrhage. The diffuse alveolar haemorrhage syn-\\ndromes are characterised by bleeding into the alveolar spaces and may result from a number of causes (e.g., prolonged anticoagulant therapy, Wegener granulomatosis, Goodpasture syndrome). Haemoptysis is the usual pre-dominant symptom but it may be absent. General examination may reveal features of a vasculitic or rheumatological disorder. The chest radiograph often shows diffuse bilateral opacities. The diagnosis is made by fiberoptic bronchoscopy and sequential bronchioalveolar lavage.\\nAtelectasis. Atelectasis is defined as lung parenchyma not containing \\nair, which is due to obstruction (e.g., endobronchial cancer, foreign body) or compression (e.g., pneumothorax, pleural effusion). The main symptom is dyspnoe. Physical examination allows the detection of relatively large ate-\\nlectases. Radiologically, the most important radiologic characteristics are: localized opacity, volume loss, absence of air bronchograms, displacement of a fissure, elevation of the diaphragm, displacement of the mediastinum including the trachea, displacement of the hilum, reduced intercostal space. The diagnosis of the cause of atelectasis requires CT of the chest and fiber-bronchoscopy.\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\n1. Haroon A., Higa F., Haranaga S., et al.

Broncho-obstructive syndrome (BOS) is the collective \\nterm including a symptom-complex of outlined clinical implications of distur -\\nbance of bronchial permeability, having in the basis narrowing or an occlusion \\nof respiratory tracts.\\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY. Basic mechanisms of bronchial obstruction \\ninclude:\\n1) bronchial muscle spasm;\\n2) edema and infiltration of bronchial mucosa and submucosa;\\n3) overproduction of sputum and dyskrinia (viscous sputum);\\n4) sclerosis of bronchial wall;\\n5) expiratory collapse of bronchi;\\n6) mechanical factors (a foreign body in the lumenus of bronchus, com-pression of bronchus from outside).\\nCLINICAL PRESENT ATIONSymptoms commonly include dyspnea (expiratory and/ or insiratory), \\nchronic cough, (initially intermittent, then become daily and often whole day and only rarely at night) and chronic expectoration of sputum.\\nPhysical examination. Inspection reveals cyanosis, finger clubbing, bar-\\nrel-like chest chest (in case of emphysema) and pitting edema (in case of right heart failure). Chest palpation reveals diffusely decreased tactile fre-mitus in case of emphysema. On chest percussion there is hyperresonant sound (in emphysema or asthma attack), moving the upper limit of the lungs upwards and lowering the lower limit of the lungs and limitation of lower lung border mobility. Chest auscultation can reveal the following changes: wheezes and/ or rhonchi (as a hallmark) or diffusely decreased vesicular murmur (in emphysema) or unchanged (in a controlled bronchial asthma).\\nSpirometry is an obligatory method to confirm the presence of bron-\\ncho-obstructive syndrome. In a typical case, an obstructive defect is present in the form of normal or reduced forced vital capacity (FVC), reduced FEV1, ratio FEV1/FVC < 70%, documentation of reversibility (>12% of FEV1 improvement after 20 minutes of a short-acting bronchodilator administra-tion) of airway obstruction, reduced forced expiratory flow over 25-75% of the FVC (FEF 25-75) and the flow-volume loop can be concave.\\n\\n110\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEBody pletismography: increased residual volume (RV) and increased \\ntotal lung capacity (TLC) in case of emphysema.\\nCommon causes of bronchial obstruction:\\n• Bronchial asthma\\n• Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\\n• Acute bronchitis\\n• Left heart failure\\n• Gastroesophageal reflux disease\\n• Chronic sinusitis\\n• Bronchiectasis\\n• Pulmonary embolism\\nLess common causes of bronchial obstruction:• Alpha1-antitripsin deficiency\\n• Aspergillosis\\n• Cystic fibrosis\\n• Tuberculosis of bronchi\\n• Local obstruction by tumor or foreign body aspiration\\n• Bronchiolitis\\n• Vocal cord dysfunction\\n• Sarcoidosis\\n• Tracheomalacia\\n• Carcinoid syndrome\\n• Churg-Strauss syndrome\\nBronchial asthma. The symptoms and signs include: increased night-\\ntime cough, cough or wheezing with physical activity, tiredness with activ-ities, restless sleep or waking up tired, worsening allergy symptoms (aller-gic rhinitis, dark circles under eyes or skin allergy). Anamnestic clues for the diagnosis: episodes may be exacerbated by exposure to irritants such as tobacco smoke or fumes from chemicals. Attacks may occur seasonally, attacks may occur upon exposure to pets and onset is in the childhood, adolescence or youth. Physical examination may be normal. The examina-tion of the nasal passages reveals nasal polyposis or nasal congestion. Chest auscultation reveals expiratory wheezes. In severe asthma the wheezes are audible without the use of a stethoscope. In patients with severe exacerba-tions, status asthmaticus, the lung examination reveals diffusely decreased vesicular murmur, patients may use accessory muscles of respiration. Pul-monary function testing in bronchial asthma includes: decreased forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1), normal forced vital capacity\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE111\\n(FVC) and decreased FEV1/FVC ratio less than 70%. The diagnosis of \\nasthma is confirmed by demonstrating reversibility of airflow obstruction \\n(usually defined as improvement in FEV1 by at least 12% and 200 mL) to short-acting bronchodilator.\\nPeak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) in bronchial asthma demonstrates:• Diurnal variability (defined as [evening PEFR – morning PEFR]/ 0.5x [evening PEFR + morning PEFR];\\n• The diagnosis of asthma is supported if PEFR varies by at least 20% for 3 days a week over several weeks;\\n• PEFR increases by at least 15% in response to asthma treatment (reversibility).\\n• In a patient with bronchial asthma sputum contains eosinophyles, Charcot – Leiden crystals and Kurshman spirals.\\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a disorder in \\nwhich subsets of patients may have dominant features of chronic bron-chitis or emphysema and the onset is in the middle age in a patient with a history of smoking. The result is airflow obstruction that is not fully revers-ible. Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as the presence of chronic productive cough for 3 months during each of 2 consecutive years (other causes of cough being excluded). Emphysema is defined pathologically as an abnormal, permanent enlargement of the air spaces distal to the ter-minal bronchioles, accompanied by destruction of their walls and without obvious fibrosis.\\nPatients typically present with a combination of signs and symptoms of \\nchronic bronchitis, emphysema, and reactive airway disease: cough, usually worse in the mornings and productive of a small amount of colorless sputum, expiratory dyspnea and wheezing. During exertion and exacerbations the symptoms worsen, e.g., there is an increase of amount and purulency of spu\\n-\\ntum. Physical examination reveals the following: tachypnea and respiratory distress (in exacerbation), use of accessory respiratory muscles and paradox\\n-\\nical indrawing of lower intercostal spaces (Hoover sign), cyanosis, elevated jugular venous pulse, peripheral edema, hyperinflation (barrel chest), hyper\\n-\\nresonance on percussion, diffusely decreased breath sounds and wheezes.\\nCertain characteristics allow differentiation between a disease that is \\npredominantly emphysema (type A) and that which is predominantly chronic bronchitis (type B). Type A characteristics include the following: patients may be very thin with a barrel chest, little or no cough or expecto-ration, breathing may be assisted by pursed lips and use of accessory respira-\\n\\n112\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEtory muscles, patients may adopt the tripod sitting position, the chest may \\nbe hyperresonant and heart sounds are very distant. Type B characteristics include the following: obesity, frequent cough and expectoration, use of accessory muscles of respiration, coarse rhonchi and wheezing on auscul-tation and signs of right heart failure due to cor pulmonale such as jugular vein distension, edema, hepatomegaly and cyanosis. Systemic extrapulmo-nary manifestations of COPD include: systemic inflammation, scheletal muscles wasting, erythrocytosis, anemia, osteopenia and osteoporosis.\\nIn COPD the pulmonary function tests are as follows: obstructive pat-\\ntern on a flow volume loop, reduction in forced expiratory flow in the first second (FEV1), reduction of FEV1/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio < 70%, increased residual volume (RV), increased total lung capacity (TLC) and partial or complete irreversibility of bronchial obstruction (< 12% of FEV1 improvement after 20 minutes of a short-acting bronchodilator administration). Chest radiographs reveal the following: flattening of the diaphragm, increased retrosternal air space, a long, narrow heart shadow, rapidly tapering vascular shadows accompanied by hyperlucency of the lungs; increased bronchovascular markings and cardiomegaly (in bron-chitic phenotype). HRCT scans show small subpleural areas of hyperlu-cency characteristic of paraseptal emphysema and a phenomenon of air trapping seen on CT performed in expiration. Arterial blood gas (ABG) findings are as follows: moderate hypoxemia without hypercapnia; as the disease progresses, hypoxemia worsens and hypercapnia may develop, pH usually is near normal; a pH below 7.3 generally indicates acute respiratory compromise.\\nAcute bronchitis. The disease has an acute onset and is a part of upper \\nrespiratory tract infection with conomitant rhinitis, pharyngitis, laryngitis, fever up to 38\\n0 C, myalgias, arthralgias and occasionally chills, dry cough, \\nmucopurulent sputum, expiratory dyspnoe, wheezes and rrhonchi on lung auscultaion. Chest X-ray (performed to exlude the presence of lung consol-idation) is usually unchanged or reveals increased bronchial markings. Full blood count demonstrates leukocytosis with the left shift and moderately elevated ESR. The manifestations of bronchial obstruction in acute bron-chitis are usually fully reversible after the administration of short-course glucocorticosteroids and bronchodilators.\\nLeft heart failure. About 25% of patients with left heart failure may \\npresent with wheezing, expiratory dyspnoe, wheezes and rhonchi with or without bilateral basal crackles on lung auscultation. It is important to take\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE113\\na detailed patient`s history (e.g., coronary artery disease, arterial hyperten-\\nsion, valvular heart defect). Suggestive physical findings are acrocyanosis, ortopnoe, dependent oedema, elevated jugular venous pressure, elevated blood pressure, decresed S\\n1 on apex, pathological S3, different arrhythmias \\n(e.g., atrial fibrillation), hepatomegaly, anasarca. An important biological marker is BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) which is elevated in serum. ECG demonstrates the presence of arrhythmias, ST elevation, signs of hyper-throphy of the left ventricle. Chest X-ray shows increased alveolar mark-ings, fluid in fissures, Kerley A and B lines, pleural effusions, rapid clearing after treatment of underlying disease, especially with diuretics. The echo-cardiogram reveals reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, dilatation of cardiac cavities (especially the left ones), presence of hypokynesia zones, presence of valvular heart defects etc.\\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (see Differential diagnosis of dysphagia)Chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis may present with nocturnal and \\nmorning cough and dyspnoea from post-nasal discharge. It may co-exist with bronchial asthma. Anterior rhinoscopy and nasal endoscopy reveal inflammation, purulent discharge, oedema and polyps. Computed tomog-raphy shows mucosal thickening of the respective sinus and air-fliud level.\\nBronchiectasis. The suggestive clinical features are as follows: dysp-\\nnoea, cough with abundant mucopurulent or purulent sputum, wheezing, ocasioanlly hemoptisis, and recurrent pulmonary infections (Meticillin-re-sistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Aspergillus spp.) 3 per \\nyear or more. High-resolution CT chest shows dilated airways, bronchial wall thickening and ring sign (the diameter of bronchus is more than the diameter of the adjacent artery). Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is helpful for the detection of bronchiectasis, obtaining secretions for culture and treatment.\\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA) is a hypersensitiv-\\nity reaction resulting in the formation of IgE and IgG antibodies to Asper -\\ngillus fumigatus that has colonized bronchi of patients with asthma or cystic fibrosis. The main clinical features include: expiratory dyspnea, wheezing, fever, malaise, expectoration of brownish mucus plugs and haemoptysis. Full blood count usually reveals eosinophilia. Serological tests are posi-tive for antiAspergillus Ig G, Ig E. To obtain the evidence of Aspergillus \\ninfection the sediment from bronchoalveolar lavage should be centrifuged and processed as a cell block. The sections stained with Hematoxilin and Eosin and with PAS-diastase reveal septate fungal hyphae with dichot-omous branching, characteristic of Aspergillus. Chest CT shows multiple\\n\\n114\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEthickwalled cavitary pulmonary nodules. Ex juvantibus criterion: ABPA \\nmay regress under control measures, corticosteroids, and itraconazole.\\nAlpha1-antitripsin deficiency is a relatively common genetic condi-\\ntion, characterized by the absence of protein in the alpha1 region of the \\nSPEP . The main clinical features are slowly progressive dyspnea, cough, sputum production, wheezing and concomitant liver disease. The family history of the patient is consistant with parents or grandparents dying of lung/ liver disease. Confirmatory diagnostic test: decreased serum alpha-1 antitrypsin. Computed tomography of the chest shows emphysematous bullae in the lower lung lobes, there is also increased lung density in the areas with compression of lung tissue by the bullae. The genotype testing demonstrates the presence of the Z or M (Malton) alleles. Ex juvantibus \\ncriterion: intravenous augmentation therapy with alpha1-antitrypsin ben-efits some patients.\\nCystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an autosomal recessive genetic disease of \\nabnormal secretions from exocrine glands that involves multiple organ sys-tems caused by a defect in the gene which codes for cystic fibrosis trans-membrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Respiratory symptoms and signs usually start in childhood and may include the following: cough, recurrent wheezing, recurrent pneumonias, dyspnea on exertion, chest pain, nasal polyps, tachypnea, respiratory distress with retractions, wheeze or crackles, cough, mucoid or purulent sputum, digital clubbing, cyano-sis, increased anteroposterior chest diameter, hyperresonant sound on per-cussion. The gastrointestinal symptoms include the following: meconium ileus, abdominal distention, intestinal obstruction, increased frequency of stools, flatulence, steatorrhea, recurrent abdominal pain, dry skin, jaundice, gastrointestinal bleeding, abdominal distention, hepatosplenomegaly and rectal prolapse. The genitourinary symptoms include undescended testicles or hydrocele, delayed secondary sexual development and amenorrhea. The requirements for CF diagnosis include either positive genetic testing or positive sweat chloride test findings and 1 of the following: typical course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, documented exocrine pancre-atic insufficiency (e.g., decreased level of fecal elastase) and positive family history (usually an affected sibling). Thr parameters for the sweat chloride test are as follows: the reference value is less than 40 mmol/l, a value higher than 60 mmol/l of chloride is consistent with CF, a value of 40-60 mmol/l is considered borderline, and the test must be repeated. Imaging studies that may be helpful include the following: X-rays (chest, sinus, abdomen),\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE115\\nCT of the chest, abdominal ultrasound and contrast barium enema. Chest \\nX-ray and CT findings: atelectasis (discoid, segmental, lobar with rhight upper lobe predominance), mucoid impaction (nodular and fingerlike den-sities along bronchovascular bundle), cylindrical bronchiectasis or cysts, hilar adenopathy, pulmonary arterial hypertension, recurrent pneumo-thorax and cor pulmonale. Additional tests that may be warranted are as follows: genotyping, nasal potential difference measurement, pulmonary function testing, bronchoalveolar lavage, sputum microbiology (recurrent respiratory infections with Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa).\\nTuberculosis of bronchi. Bronchial obstruction may be caused by the \\naccumulation of caseous masses in the lumenus of bronchi. The clinical pic-ture of tuberculosis (see Differential diagnosis of pulmonary consolidation) is accompanied by expiratory dyspnoe and wheezes on lung auscultation. Chest CT and fiberbronchoscopy with biopsy and culture are necessary to confirm the diagnosis.\\nLocal obstruction by tumor or foreign body aspiration. The main fea-\\ntures include: wheezing, shortness of breath and occasional stridor. If the foreign body is in the peripheral airway, localized one-sided wheezing or collapse of the distal lung tissue is found. Chest X-rays and CT chest show sign of atelectasis. CT chest or bronchoscopy shows the foreign body or endobronchial tumor.\\nVocal cord dysfunction. Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD), or paradox-\\nical vocal fold motion, is characterized as an abnormal adduction of the vocal cords during the respiratory cycle (especially during the inspiratory phase) that produces airflow obstruction at the level of the larynx with-out an organic basis. The larynx receives very extensive sensory and motor innervation. In repeated stimulation and excitation by noxious intrinsic and extrinsic irritants, these nerve fibers may become hyperexcitable and hyperresponsive and the threshold for activation of the reflex responsible for vocal cords closure is lowered. VCD frequently mimics persistent\\xa0bron-chial asthma with the symptoms of wheezing, cough, and dyspnea often being treated with corticosteroids and bronchodilators. It is important that patients with VCD often seem to have refractory asthma with poor response to beta-agonists or inhaled corticosteroids and they do not usu-ally report nocturnal awakening due to breathlessness. Flow-volume loops obtained during spirometry show a limitation of inspiratory flow suggestive of variable extrathoracic obstruction (inspiratory loop flattening). The par-adoxical vocal cord motion can be confirmed on laryngoscopy performed\\n\\n116\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEwhen patients are symptomatic. The hallmark of diagnosis is noted on \\ndirect laryngoscopy: a glottic chink is present along the posterior portion of the vocal cords, while the anterior portion of the vocal cords is adducted.\\nTracheomalacia. Expiratory stridor and a barking cough, and wheez-\\ning with additional breath sound at the end of expiration are accompanied by the occasional extension of the neck with breathing, inspiratory stri-dor, episodes of holding of breath, anoxia, recurrent respiratory infections, retraction of intercostal and subcostal muscles, failure to thrive, and respira-tory and cardiac arrest. The symptoms are usually positionally dependent and occur within the first weeks or months of life. Confirmatory methods of diagnosis include laryngoscopy, bronchoscopy, barium esophagography (useful for evaluating associated tracheoesophageal fistula and reflux dis-ease).\\nCarcinoid syndrome (due to carcinoid neuroendocrine tumors). \\nMalignant carcinoid syndrome occurs in fewer than 10% of patients with a carcinoid tumor of neuroendocrine origin. These tumors follow the so-called rule of one third, which states as follows: one third of these tum-ors are multiple, one third of those in the gastrointestinal tract are located in the small bowel, one third of patients have a second malignancy and one third of these tumors metastasize.\\nIt is known that carcinoids may produce: serotonin, gastrin, adrenocor-\\nticotropic hormone, histamine, acid phosphatase, α-glycoprotein, α1-antit-\\nrypsin, amylin, atrial natriuretic polypeptide, catecholamines, chromogranin A and B, dopamine, fibroblast growth factor, gastrin, gastrin-releasing pep-tide (bombesin), glucagon/glicentin, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), insulin, kallikrein, motilin, A-Neuropep-tide, K-Neuropeptide, neurotensin, pancreastatin, pancreatic polypeptide, platelet-dermal growth factor, prostaglandins, secretin, somatostatin, sub-stance P , somatotropin release-inhibiting factor, tachykinins, β-transform-ing growth factor (β-TGF) and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP). \\nMalignant carcinoid syndrome is characterized by hot, red flushing of \\nthe face, severe diarrhea and asthma attacks caused by vasoactive hormones secreted by metastases from carcinoid tumors. Flushing is a phenomenon in which transient vasodilation causes reddening of the face, head, neck, and the upper chest and epigastric areas. Flushing is the most frequent symptom and may be brief (2-5 min) or may last for several hours, usu-ally in later disease stages. Flushing may be accompanied by tachycardia, while the blood pressure usually falls or does not change. Some patients\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE117\\nalso develop telangiectasia on the face and neck. Right heart problems may \\ndevelop because of the development of tricuspid valve insufficiency. Bron-chial constriction, which accounts for the asthma-like attacks, seems related to the tumoral tachykinins. Carcinoid crisis is a dangerous life-threatening condition that can occur at the time of surgery. It is characterized by a sudden and profound drop in blood pressure causing shock, sometimes accompanied by tachycardia, high blood glucose, and severe bronchospasm.\\nCarcinoid tumors can be found by endoscopy, barium small intestinal \\nX-ray studies, capsule enteroscopy. Their diagnosis requires a biopsy to provide a tissue sample. Metastatic carcinoid tumors can be diagnosed by CT or MRI scans, indium 111 octreotide scans, and bone scans. The bio-chemical diagnosis of carcinoid tumors is based on the measurement of the serotonin metabolite 5-HIAA in a 24-hour urine collection (normal value = 0-8.9 mg/d, a urinary excretion of 5-HIAA of 25 mg/d is diagnostic of carcinoid) and elevated Chromogranin A in blood.\\nAcute bronchiolitis is a leading cause of hospital admission in infants \\nunder 1 year of age and Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common aetiological agent. Most cases are mild and self-limited, and supportive care is the only indicated therapy. Recurrent wheezing is a common com-plication, and it can be treated with inhaled corticosteroids and leukotriene antagonists.\\nSarcoidosis is a multisystem inflammatory disease of unknown eti-\\nology that manifests as noncaseating granulomas, predominantly in the lungs and intrathoracic lymph nodes. The presentation in sarcoidosis var-ies with the extent and severity of organ involvement, as follows: systemic complaints (fever, anorexia), pulmonary complaints (dyspnea on exertion, cough, chest pain, and rare hemoptysis), Löfgren syndrome (fever, bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy, and polyarthralgias). On physical examination the pulmonary findings are as follows: no changes, crackles or wheezes may be audible, exertional oxygen desaturation. Dermatologic manifestations may include the following: erythema nodosum, a lower-extremity panniculitis with painful, erythematous nodules (often with Löfgren syndrome), lupus pernio, and violaceous rash on the cheeks or nose. Ocular involvement, which may lead to blindness if untreated, may manifest as follows: anterior or posterior granulomatous uveitis, conjunctival lesions and scleral plaques. Other possible manifestations are as follows: bone involvement, heart failure from cardiomyopathy, heart block and sudden death, lymphocytic meningitis, cranial nerve palsies and hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction.\\n\\n118\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINELaboratory and imaging studies for sarcoidosis are as follows: 1) labo-\\nratory abnormalities (elevated ESR, hypercalcemia, hypercalciuria, elevated \\nalkaline phosphatase level and elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels); 2) Chest radiography which is central to the evaluation of the disease staging (Stage 0: Normal chest radiographic findings; Stage I: Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy; Stage II: Bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy and infiltrates; Stage III: Infiltrates alone; Stage IV: Fibrosis); 3) High-res-\\nolution CT (HRCT) scanning of the chest (identifies active alveolitis versus fibrosis, and findings correlate with biopsy yield); 4) pulmonary function tests (a restrictive pattern is usually seen and 15-20% of patients have obstructive pattern), a decreased carbon monoxide diffusion capacity DLCO); 5) bronchoscopy with transbronchial biopsy (the main histologic finding is the presence of noncaseating granulomas with special stains neg-ative for fungus and mycobacteria). Ex juvantibus criterion: systemic corti-costeroids usually effective until stage IV of the disease.\\nChurg-Strauss syndrome. Churg-Strauss syndrome, or eosinophilic \\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis, is a rare systemic necrotizing antineu-trophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis that affects small-to-medium-sized vessels and is associated with severe asthma and blood and tissue eosinophilia. The American College of Rheumatology proposed the following six criteria for the diagnosis of Churg-Strauss syn-drome (CSS): asthma (wheezing, expiratory rhonchi), eosinophilia of more than 10% in peripheral blood, paranasal sinusitis, transient pulmonary infiltrates, histological proof of vasculitis with extravascular eosinophils and mononeuritis multiplex or polyneuropathy. CSS has three phases, as follows: 1) allergic rhinitis and asthma; 2) eosinophilic infiltrative disease (e.g., eosinophilic pneumonia or gastroenteritis); 3) systemic medium– and small-vessel vasculitis with granulomatous inflammation. The vasculitic phase usually develops within 3 years of the onset of asthma, although it may be delayed for several decades. The most prominent symptoms and signs are those related to pulmonary, cardiac, dermatologic, renal, and peripheral nerve involvement. The following symptoms and signs of the disease were reported: constitutional symptoms (malaise, fatigue, flu-like symptoms, weight loss, fever and myalgias), respiratory symptoms (persis-tent expiratory dyspnea even treated with corticosteroids, nasal discharge due to paranasal sinusitis, allergic rhinitis or nasal polyposis, cough and hemoptysis), arthralgias, skin manifestations (skin nodules, urticarial rash, necrotic bulla, digital ischemia), cardiac manifestations (heart failure, myo-\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE119\\ncarditis, pericarditis and myocardial infarction), gastrointestinal symptoms \\ndue to eosinophilic gastritis or colitis (abdominal pain, diarrhea and gas-trointestinal bleeding). Laboratory findings include: eosinophilia, usually with at least 10% eosinophils (or 5000-9000 eosinophils/µL), anemia and elevation of ESR in complete blood cell count; proteinuria, microscopic hematuria, and red blood cell casts in urinalysis; elevated blood urea nitro-gen (BUN) and serum creatinine levels in case of renal involvement; the presence of antineutrophil perinuclear antimyeloperoxidase cytoplasmic antibodies (p-ANCAs); elevated serum IgE levels, hypergammaglobu-linemia, positive results for rheumatoid factor at low titer, elevated levels of ECP – eosinophil cationic protein and sIL-2R – soluble interleukin-2 receptor (indicate an immunoregulatory defect associated with vasculitis and eosinophilia); elevated sTM – soluble thrombomodulin (a marker of endothelial cell damage). Bronchoscopia with bronchoalveolar lavage reveals eosinophilia. CT chest may reveal small (< 10 mm) centrilobular nodules, ground-glass opacities, bronchial wall thickening, bronchial dila-tation, consolidation, interlobular septal thickening and unilateral or bilat-eral pleural effusion. Other imaging studies are: abdominal CT scanning for pancreatitis, coronary angiography for myocardial ischemia and infarc-tion, and echocardiography for congestive heart failure.\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\n1.

Diffuse interstitial lung diseases (DILD) are a group \\nof diseases that have the common characteristic of involving the pulmo-\\nnary parenchyma diffusely. DILD are numerous, there are some 150 differ-\\nent entities that qualify for the group. Most of these diseases are diagnosed according to common algorithm, but the etiology, prognosis and therapy are \\nquite different. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is defined as a specific \\nform of chronic, progressive fibrosing interstitial pneumonia of unknown \\ncause, occurring primarily in older adults, and limited to the lungs.\\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY. A large and diverse group of pathologic \\nconditions manifests clinically and radiologically as diffuse parenchymal lung disease. In practice, this group of disorders has been categorized on \\nthe basis of clinical dysfunction (‘‘restrictive lung disease’’) or radiologic \\nappearance (‘‘interstitial lung disease (ILD)’’), neither of which accurately \\nreflects the pathologic processes involved. Diffuse ILDs encompass mainly inflammatory processes that involve the structural elements of this organ. Some ILDs are caused by infections, but most are the result of immu-\\nnologic, environmental, or toxic mechanisms. These diseases are discussed \\ntogether because they have in common the tendency to produce bilateral \\nabnormalities on chest imaging studies and are mainly nonneoplastic con-\\nditions. A small number of diffuse inflammatory conditions came to light that exclusively involved the lungs and did not seem to be caused by infec-\\ntion, toxin, sarcoidosis, pneumoconiosis, or neoplasm.\\nThe known causes are diverse inorganic agents leading to pneumoconi-\\noses (asbestos, silica, etc.), organic, causing hypersensitivity pneumonitis (farmer’s lung, bird fancier’s lung, etc.), drugs, irradiation, toxic gases and \\nfumes, bacteria, fungi, viruses, protozoa, and parasitic infections or infesta-\\ntions. The inflammatory process is limited specifically to the area between \\nthe alveolar epithelium. This group of pulmonary disorders frequently involves: alveolar epithelium, alveolar space, pulmonary microvasculature,  \\nrespiratory bronchioles, larger airways and capillary endothelial basement membranes. There are also many other causes of interstitial lung disease. In some cases, the cause of interstitial disease is also unknown. Occasionally, \\ninterstitial disease is associated with a familial cause or specific genetic dis-\\nease. All the possible etiologic factors, including environmental or occupa-tional, have to be excluded for a DILD to be considered idiopathic.\\n\\n122\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEClassification of Diffuse Interstitial Lung Disease (DILD)\\nDILD OF KNOWN CAUSE\\n• Anorganic particles – pneumoconiosis\\n• Organic particles – hypersensitivity pneumonitis\\n• Gases\\n• Fumes\\n• Irradiation\\n• Microbes\\nIDIOPATHIC INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONIAS\\n• Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF)\\n• Non – specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP)\\n• Organizing pneumonia (OP)\\n• Desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP)\\n• Respiratory bronchiolitis – interstitial lung disease (RB – ILD)\\n• Lymphoid interstitial pneumonia (LIP)\\n• Pleuropulmonary fibroelastosis (PPFE)\\nGRANULOMATOSIS\\n• Sarcoidosis\\n• Granulomatosis with polyangitis ( Wegener’s granulomatosis)\\n• Churg – Strauss syndrome\\n• Necrotizing sarcoid granuloma\\n• Lymphomatoid granulomatosis\\n• Bronchocentric granulomatosis\\n• Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH)\\n• Erdheim – Chester disease\\nRARE DPLD\\n• Alveolar proteinosis\\n• Alveolar mikrolithiasis\\n• Amyloidosis\\n• Eosinophilic pneumonia\\n• Lymphangioleiomyomatos (LAM)\\n• Idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis\\n• Pulmonary manifestation of connective tissue diseases\\nIdiopathic interstitial pneumonias according to new classification com-\\nprise of several entities, among them there is a new entity called pleuropul-monary fibroelastosis. The inclusion of a category of unclassifiable group of DILD is also, of great help to practicing physicians. The everyday life experience resulted in this change, because almost 30% of these diseases\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE123\\neven after the most complete and thorough examination, stay unclassifia-\\nble. The third group consists of diseases that histologically show the pat-tern of granuloma, like sarcoidosis. And finally, the fourth group consists of diverse, mostly rare diseases. Among them are diffuse connective tis-sue diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic sclerosis, ankylosing spondylitis, mixed connective tissue), lymphangioleio-myomatosis, alveolar proteinosis and alveolar microlythiasis. Some of these diseases are benign and self-limiting, others are chronic, progressive, irre-versible, and fatal. The lung manifestation may be the one manifestation of a systemic process. Or it may be the only organ affected. All DPLDs, however, have certain common clinical, imaging, and physiologic features that should be recognized.\\nRevised ATS/ERS classification of idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs)MAJOR Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia\\n• Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\\n• Idiopathic nonspecific interstitial pneumonia\\n• Respiratory bronchiolitis – interstitial lung disease\\n• Desquamative interstitial pneumonia\\n• Cryptogenic organizing pneumonia\\n• Acute interstitial pneumonia \\nRARE Idiopathic Interstitial Pneumonia\\n• Idiopathic lymphoid interstitial pneumonia\\n• Idiopathic pleuroparenchymal fibroelastosis\\nUNCLASSIFIABLE Idiopathic Interstitial PneumoniaCauses of unclassifiable idiopathic interstitial pneumonia include: \\ninadequate clinical, radiologic, or pathologic data and major discordance between clinical, radiologic, and pathologic findings that may occur in the following situations: previous therapy resulting in substantial alteration of radiologic or histologic findings (e.g., biopsy of desquamative interstitial pneumonia after steroid therapy, which shows only residual nonspecific interstitial pneumonia; new entity, or unusual variant of recognized entity, not adequately characterized by the current American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification (variant of organizing pneu-monia with supervening fibrosis); and multiple high-resolution com-puted tomography and/or pathologic patterns that may be encountered in patients with idiopathic interstitial pneumonia.\\n\\n124\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINECOMMON CLINICAL FEATURES\\nThe most common symptoms of diffuse interstitial lung disease are \\nshortness of breath and dry cough. As the disease progresses, weight \\nloss, exercice limitation, retrosternal chest pain (in sarcoidosis), myalgias, arthralgias, and fatigue may also occur. At a more advanced stage, patients may develop right heart failure, finger clubbing, and\\xa0cyanosis. Auscultation of the lungs reveals end inspiratory crackle and velcro crackles. Wheezing is present in 20% of the patients with hypersensitivity pneumonitis as well as the squawk, the ominous auscultatory sign, typical for advanced pulmonary hypertension. Pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale become evident when the signs include a loud P2, right-sided precordial lift, jugulovenous distension with a prominent A wave, and right-sided gallop.\\nSome extrapulmonary signs can be useful in differential diagnosis:\\n• Digital clubbing – for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and asbestosis;\\n• A maculopapular rash – for connective-tissue diseases or drug-in-duced lung disease;\\n• Erythema nodosum – for sarcoidosis;\\n• Raynaud phenomenon – for connective-tissue diseases, especially in scleroderma;\\n• Teleangiectasia – for scleroderma;\\n• Peripheral lymphadenopathy, salivary gland enlargement and hepatosplenomegaly – for sarcoidosis;\\n• Uveitis – for sarcoidosis and ankylosing spondylitis;\\n• Palpable purpura – for vasculitis.\\nDIAGNOSTIC APPROACH\\nThe most helpful diagnostic procedures are radiographic imaging, chest \\nX– ray and high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial lung biopsy. To determine the cause of interstitial lung disease, a physician may perform a physical examination and administer diagnostic tests, including:\\nChest X-rays. The patterns of lung damage associated with various \\ntypes of interstitial lung disease are often identifiable on chest x-rays. Chest x-rays may also be used to track the progression of interstitial lung disease.\\xa0\\nChest HRCT (high resolution computed tomography) is the most \\nimportant imaging method for the assessment of ILD owing to its sensi-tivity and specificity. In addition, it plays a specific role, such as assessment\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE125\\nof disease activity and potential reversibility, prediction and evaluation of \\nresponse to therapy.\\nSpirometry reveals decreased FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in 1\\xa0sec-\\nond) and FVC (forced vital capacity), consecutively, an increased FEV1/FVC ratio.\\nBody pletysmography is absolutely necessary to observe a reduced RV \\n(residual volume) and reduced total lung capacity (TLC).\\nDLCO  (the measurement of the diffusing capacity for carbon mon-\\noxide), an indicator of the adequacy of the alveolar-capillary membrane, is helpful to differentiate chest bellows (DLCO normal) from parenchymal disease (DLCO decreased).\\nBronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) has expanded the understanding of \\nthe pathogenesis of many interstitial lung diseases. The minimally inva-sive bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) procedure is an important diagnostic instrument that can facilitate the diagnosis of various diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLD). BAL fluid white blood cell profiles are analyzed, malignant cells looked for, and in certain circumstances particular stains are performed to detect yet other cell types. Additionally, BAL can play a very important role in the diagnosis of respiratory tract infections.\\nSurgical biopsy: A surgical biopsy may be needed to obtain a larger \\ntissue sample than it is possible with bronchoscopy. During this procedure, surgical instruments and a small camera are inserted through two or three small incisions between ribs, allowing a physician to see and remove tissue samples from the lungs.\\nSerum and BAL biomarkers. There are limited retrospective data \\non the predictive value of serum and BAL biomarkers in IPF. KL-6 is \\na high-molecular-weight glycoprotein, classified as human MUC1 mucin \\nthat is produced by regenerating type II pneumocytes. Serum levels of \\nKL-6 have been shown to be elevated in patients with IPF, and these lev-\\nels may correlate with increased risk of subsequent mortality. Serum lev-\\nels of surfactant protein A and D are also elevated. Alternative diagnostic hypotheses should be in patients with IPF and are predictive of survival.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS\\nIdiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs) are a heterogeneous group \\nof non-neoplastic lung diseases in which the lung parenchyma is damaged by varying patterns of inflammation and/or fibrosis. The American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification of IIPs, published in\\n\\n126\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE2002 (and currently under revision), defines the morphological patterns on \\nwhich clinical, radiological and pathological diagnosis of IIPs is found in 50–70% of the biopsy-proven cases. When present, it allows a noninvasive diagnosis to be made with other IIPs, a confident diagnosis requires biopsy.\\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis The term IPF refers to a distinct type \\nof chronic fibrosing pneumonia of unknown cause. It is the most com-mon of the IIPs, accounting for about 50–60% of IIP cases. The prognosis is usually dismal, with a median survival time of 2–4 years from diagno-sis. On chest HRCT, IPF is characterized by the UIP pattern, which is predominantly subpleural with an apical–basal gradient. Specific findings of UIP pattern include honeycombing, peripheral reticular opacities that determine irregular interfaces between the lung and pleura, intralobular interstitial thickening with minimal abnormality, traction bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis. Lower lobe volume loss is also a common finding.\\nNonspecific interstitial pneumonia is a pathological term used to \\ndescribe interstitial inflammation and fibrosis with temporal and spatial uni -\\nformity that does not fulfil the clinical–pathological criteria. NSIP can be observed in a number of conditions, such as collagen vascular diseases, inha\\n-\\nlation of organic/inorganic antigens, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, drug tox -\\nicity or slowly resolving acute lung injury. When no associated process can be found in a patient with a histological and radiological pattern of NSIP , the diagnosis of idiopathic NSIP is made. On HRCT, the disease is usually distributed bilaterally with basal and peripheral predominance. The most common feature is peripheral irregular linear or reticular opacities in 50% of cases. Consolidation occurs in 20% of patients. Traction bronchiectasis and micronodules can also be present. The differentiation between fibrotic NSIP and UIP requires surgical lung biopsy. At present, there is no single feature or combination of HRCT features that have high specificity for a histolog\\n-\\nical diagnosis of NSIP . The features of UIP and organising pneumonia may overlap with fibrotic and cellular NSIP .\\nCryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) is often secondary to a \\nknown cause such as collagen vascular disease, viral pneumonia or drug reactions. The term COP , which refers to idiopathic organizing pneumonia, better defines the disease previously known as bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia (BOOP), as the main abnormality is the organ-izing pneumonia whereas the bronchiolar obstruction may be absent in up to one-third of the cases. HRCT features of COP are represented by multiple areas of consolidations, which are commonly bilateral, patchy and\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE127\\nasymmetric, peripheral, and migrating (in up to 90% of cases). The lower \\nlung zones are more frequently affected. Other HRCT findings include small centrilobular nodules, irregular lines, and the ‘atoll sign’or ‘reversed halo sign’ representing peripheral consolidation. The lung volumes are gen-erally preserved. COP tends to involve preferentially the subpleural and bronchovascular regions of the lung parenchyma. Bronchial dilation and air bronchogram associated with regions of consolidation can also be pres-ent. The imaging findings in these cases can often be mistaken for pneu-monic consolidation. However, the foci of consolidation generally involve the lower lung zones and have a tendency to migrate, especially in the case of relapses, reported in one-third of cases. Few cases progress to irreversible fibrosis, probably representing the overlap between organizing pneumonia and NSIP .\\nRespiratory bronchiolitis-associated ILD is a part of the spectrum \\nof smoking-related lung diseases. It is a distinct histopathological lesion found in the lungs of virtually all cigarette smokers. It usually represents an incidental finding and, as such, is of little clinical significance. Much less often, patients who are heavy smokers develop RB-ILD, a clinical–patho-logical entity characterized by pulmonary symptoms, abnormal pulmonary function test (PFT) results and imaging abnormalities, with respiratory bronchiolitis being the histological lesion on surgical lung biopsy. It is pos-sible that RB-ILD and DIP are similar processes but at the opposite ends of the disease spectrum. The most common HRCT findings are centrilob-ular nodules, patchy and thickening of the bronchial walls, which predom-inate in the upper lobes accumulation in the distal airspaces. Upper lobe emphysema is also commonly present as a result of smoking. Air trapping is frequently seen in expiratory scans. A small percentage of patients has a reticular pattern in the absence of honeycombing and traction bronchiec-tasis. The differential diagnosis of RB-ILD includes acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis, DIP and NSIP . An important finding that may help to dis-tinguish RB-ILD from DIP is the presence of centrilobular nodules and unusual presence of cyst formations in RB-ILD.\\nDesquamative interstitial pneumonia is a rare form of ILD. DIP is \\nstrongly associated with cigarette smoking and is considered to represent the end of a spectrum of RB-ILD. DIP may also occur in nonsmokers and has been related to a variety of conditions, including lung infections, exposure to organic dust and marijuana smoke inhalation. For the major-ity of patients, the onset of symptoms is between 30 and 40 years of age.\\n\\n128\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEMales are affected about twice as commonly as females. The prognosis is \\ngood with smoking cessation and corticosteroid therapy. On HRCT, DIP is characterized by diffuse or patchy GGOs, which is caused by diffuse macrophage infiltration of the alveoli, and thickening of the alveolar septa with peripheral and basal lung predominance. Lung biopsy is required for a definite diagnosis.\\nLymphoid interstitial pneumonia can be idiopathic, exceedingly rare, \\nor secondary to systemic disorders, in particular Sjogren’s syndrome, HIV infection and variable immunodeficiency syndromes. LIP is more common in females than in males, and patients are usually in their fifth decade of life at presentation. HRCT shows bilateral abnormalities that are diffuse or have lower lung predominance. Another frequent finding is thin-walled perivascular cysts. They are the only finding that may be irreversible. In contrast to the subpleural, lower lung cystic changes in UIP , the cysts of LIP are usually within the lung parenchyma throughout the mid-lung zones and presumably result from air trapping due to peribronchiolar cel-lular infiltration. Occasionally, centrilobular nodules and septal thickening are seen.\\nAcute interstitial pneumonia is acute respiratory distress syndrome \\n(ARDS) of unknown cause. The disease commonly has a symmetric, bilat-eral distribution with lower lobe predominance. Areas of consolidation are also present but usually they are less extensive and limited to the depend-ent area of the lung. In the early phase, airspace consolidation results from intra-alveolar oedema and haemorrhage. However, consolidations are also present in the fibrotic phase, thus resulting from intra-alveolar fibrosis. In the late phase of AIP , architectural distortion, traction bronchiectasis within consolidation and honeycombing are the most striking CT features and represent fibrotic change. They are more severe in the non-dependent areas of the lung. This can be explained by the ‘protective’ effect of ate-lectasis and consolidation on the dependent areas of the lung during the acute phase of disease, which attenuate the potential damage associated with mechanical ventilation.\\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis is an immunologically induced inflam-\\nmatory disease involving the lung parenchyma and terminal airways sec-ondary to repeated inhalation of a variety of organic dusts and other agents in a sensitized host. Classically, it can be separated into three phases: acute, subacute and chronic, depending on the temporality relative to initial exposure. A significant clinical and radiological overlap can often occur\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE129\\nbetween these phases. Acute hypersensitivity pneumonitis presents within \\na few hours of substantial antigen exposure. HRCT scans, rarely obtained at this stage, demonstrate diffuse or geographic distribution, and mosaic perfusion areas due to air trapping (better or only recognized on expiratory scans). Subacute hypersensitivity pneumonitis occurs in response to inter-mittent or low-dose antigen exposure. HRCT is particularly helpful at this stage of diseases and is characterised by varying proportions with poorly defined centrilobular nodules and areas of decreased attenuation, due to constrictive bronchiolitis with expiratory air trapping. Chronic hypersensi-tivity pneumonitis occurs after long-term, low-dose antigen exposure and usually shows a fibrotic pattern resembling UIP or fibrotic NSIP . HRCT findings include irregular reticular opacities, small nodules, honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis as well as areas of air trapping and spared lob-ules, with a heterogeneous appearance, called the ‘head cheese sign’. Open lung biopsy is required to make a definite diagnosis in borderline cases.\\nSarcoidosis (see Differential diagnosis of Broncho – Obstructive Syn-\\ndrome)\\nEosinophylic pneumonia (see Differential diagnosis of pulmonary \\nconsolidation)\\nPneumoconiosis is a lung condition that is caused by inhaling parti-\\ncles of mineral dust, usually while working in a high-risk, mineral-related industry. Initially, irritating mineral dust can trigger lung inflammation, which causes areas of the lung to be temporarily damaged. Over time, these areas can progress to form tough, fibrous tissue deposits (fibrosis). Fibrosis stiffens the lungs and interferes with the lung\\'s normal exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\\nThere are several different types of pneumoconiosis.Asbestosis is the general name for a family of irritating fibrous minerals \\nthat are mined from underground deposits and used in the manufacture of home insolation, fireproof materials, tiles for floors and ceilings, and other products. Workers with the highest asbestos exposure include miners, con-struction workers, demolition workers, shipbuilders and those who work with brakes. Asbestos exposure can also affect people who live or work in buildings where asbestos-containing building products are deteriorating. In most cases, signs of asbestosis do not develop for 20 or more years after a person is first exposed to asbestos dust.\\nSilicosis affects people who work with silica, usually in the form of \\nquartz that is found in sand, sandstone, slate, some clays, granite and other\\n\\n130\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEores. Workers with the highest exposure to silica include sandblasters, \\nminers, tunnel builders, silica millers, quarry workers, foundry workers and those who make ceramics or glass. Silicosis can cause progressive fibrosis in the lung with a significant decrease in lung function, especially in cigarette smokers.\\nCoal worker\\'s pneumoconiosis is caused by inhaling carbon particles \\nfrom coal, graphite, black lamp or black carbon. It most often affects people who mine, process or ship coal; graphite miners; and workers who manu-facture synthetic graphite, black lamp or black carbon. Coal worker\\'s pneu-moconiosis, like silicosis can cause significant fibrosis, primarily in miners who have worked for decades without protective equipment.\\nTalc pneumoconiosis is caused by exposure to talc dust, usually during \\ntalc mining or milling. Talc pneumoconiosis can also lead to lung fibrosis.\\nSiderosis of the lung is caused by inhaling iron particles. Although \\nwelder\\'s lung often looks abnormal on a chest X-ray, it usually does not cause any symptoms.\\nLess often, pneumoconiosis can be caused by inhaling barium sulfate, \\ntin oxide, compounds containing hard metal (cobalt and tungsten carbide) or other forms of mineral dust.\\nThe diagnosis of pneumoconiosis requires the recognition of occupa-\\ntional exposure, the existence of an adequate latency period, the exclusion of extraprofessional causal factors, and the presence of compatible clinical, radiological and functional respiratory aspects. The CT scan performed with high-resolution technique (HRCT) shows – small opacity with reg-ular or irregular shape which also defines the location and profusion, large opacities, ground glass, honeycombing and emphysema.\\nThe pathological diagnosis of asbestosis is made in the presence of a \\ndiffuse pulmonary fibrosis with a particular pattern of asbestos bodies and/or fibers attesting a relevant exposure. In asbestosis the interstitial fibrosis is located in the basilar and subpleural regions as in idiopathic pulmo-nary fibrosis (IPF) which is the main differential diagnosis. In addition to the presence of asbestos bodies and fibers, histologically asbestosis differs from IPF in the poor inflammatory component and the lesser presence of fibroblastic foci. The very early stages, characterized by bronchiolitis, pose a difficult diagnostic problem because lesions are very similar to those smoked-related. In any case, peribronchiolar fibrosis does not represent asbestosis. The most common form of silicosis (chronic simple silicosis) occurs after a latency period of at least 10 years and can be as long as 40\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE131\\nyears. A more rapid onset is caused by intense exposure: the clinical appear-\\nance is similar, but the latency is shorter (5–10 years). In asbestosis and silicosis the most important factor in determining fibrosis is the cumulative dose.\\nIdiopatic pulmonary fibrosis complete workup and environmental his-\\ntory reveals an absence of history of significant exposure to mineral dust or metal. There are no other differentiating signs and symptoms. CXR imag-ing or HRCT show lower lobe linear fibrosis. There is a negative beryl-lium lymphocyte proliferation test (BeLPT). Lung biopsy does not show increased mineral content.\\nPulmonary vasculitis may occur as a part of one of the connective tis-\\nsue disorders or in the course of a systemic granulomatous or hypersensi-tivity vasculitis.\\nWegener’s granulomatosis is an uncommon autoimmune disease char-\\nacterized by small vessel inflammation, most often involving the respiratory or renal systems. The etiology is currently unknown, evidence suggests that environmental factors and a genetic predisposition interact to create an inappropriate autoimmune response. Wegener’s granulomatosis is charac-terized by the presence of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) which have long been suspected of the involvement in disease pathology and by necrotizing vasculitis initially described as involving three organ systems: the lung, the upper respiratory tract, and the kidneys.\\nLung involvement usually takes the form of single or multiple nodular \\nlesions that have a propensity to cavitate. In the limited form of Wege-ner’s granulomatosis, patients have a similar pathology but are free of renal disease. Both diseases respond well to cyclophosphamide. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis resembles Wegener’s but differs in three important fea-tures: there is frequent central nervous system involvement; more than 15% develop malignant lymphoma, and although cyclophosphamide may achieve remission, relapses are very common.\\nIn hypersensitivity vasculitis, pulmonary involvement is a less prom-\\ninent part of systemic disease. The disorders in which this is most com-monly seen are anaphylactoid purpura, essential mixed cryoglobulinemia, and vasculitis associated with malignancy, infection, or drugs.\\nGoodpasture syndrome There is a similarity between the two, because \\neach is initially a respiratory disorder complicated by glomerulonephritis. In each the glomerular lesions vary from deposits of fibrinoid material through exudative and proliferative reactions towards complete oblite-\\n\\n132\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEration of all glomeruli. Pulmonary lesions, however, differ markedly. The \\ntypical lesion in Goodpasture\\'s syndrome is hæmorrhage into the lungs giving rise eventually to pulmonary siderosis, whereas in Wegener\\'s syn-drome there is replacement of the lining of bronchi and accessory nasal sinuses by necrotizing granulomatous tissue which may simulate carci-noma or tuberculosis. Widespread arteritis is a constant feature of Wege-ner\\'s granulomatosis, but it is seldom found in Goodpasture\\'s syndrome. Although renal biopsy cannot distinguish between the two conditions, it is helpful in directing attention to these disorders. Biopsy of the upper air passages, however, may be diagnostic in Wegener\\'s granulomatosis. In Goodpasture\\'s syndrome, corticosteroids may have caused some mitigation of the disorder, but in the case of Wegener\\'s granulomatosis in which cor-ticosteroids were used, any benefit was only temporary. Patients are tested for serum anti-GBM antibodies by indirect immunofluorescence testing or, when available, direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with recombinant or human NC-1 α3. The presence of these antibodies confirms the diagnosis. Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) testing is positive (in a peripheral pattern) in only 25% of patients with Goodpasture syndrome. If anti-GBM antibodies are absent and patients have evidence of glomerulonephritis (hematuria, proteinuria, red cell casts detected with urinalysis, renal insufficiency, or a combination of these find-ings), renal biopsy is indicated to confirm the diagnosis. Immunofluores-cence staining of renal or lung tissue classically shows linear IgG deposi-tion along the glomeruli. These disorders are nonspecific and do not occur in linear patterns.\\nChurg-Strauss syndrome (see Differential diagnosis of broncho– \\nobstructive syndrome).\\nCollagen-vascular diseases (CVDs) involve the lungs either directly \\nor as a complication of treatment of CVD. Several different components of the respiratory system may be involved, including the airways, vessels, parenchyma, pleura, and respiratory muscles. Interstitial lung diseases (ILD) are common pulmonary complications of the CVDs. Approximately 15% of patients with interstitial lung disease have an underlying connective tissue disease.\\nThe lungs are involved in more than 50% of patients with systemic \\nsclerosis. Diffuse interstitial and alveolar fibrosis may appear with vari-able fibrous thickening of small pulmonary vessels. Pleuritis and pleural effusions are the most common pulmonary manifestations of SLE.\\n Less\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE133\\ncommonly, the evidence of alveolar injury in the form of edema and hem-\\norrhage is present. In some cases, chronic interstitial fibrosis is noted. Infections and venous thromboembolic disease are also common pulmo-nary complications of SLE.\\nIn patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) the most common inter-\\nstitial pathologic pattern is diffuse fibrosis with inflammation. Follicular bronchiolitis (development of lymphoid follicles with germinal centers) can be associated with significant airway obstruction. Other common tho-racic disorders associated with RA include rheumatoid nodules and pleural effusions. Vasculitis and pulmonary hypertension have been reported.\\nPulmonary complications of polymyositis/dermatomyositis (PM/DM) \\nare frequent, occurring in 40% of patients.The\\n manifestations include ILD, \\naspiration, pneumonia, and ventilator muscle weakness. Pulmonary disease can be seen in patients without overt muscle abnormalities. Patients may also develop pulmonary arterial hypertension, vasculitis, and diffuse alveo-lar hemorrhage.\\nDrug-induced lung disease (see Differential diagnosis of pulmonary \\nconsolidation).\\nIdiopatic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) is characterized by repeated \\nepisodes of intra-alveolar bleeding that lead to abnormal accumulation of iron as hemosiderin in alveolar macrophages and subsequent development of pulmonary fibrosis and severe anemia. IPH can occur as a primary dis-ease of the lungs or it can be secondary to cardiovascular or systemic dis-ease. In children, primary pulmonary hemosiderosis is more common than secondary types.\\nThree variants of primary pulmonary hemosiderosis are recognized: \\npulmonary hemosiderosis associated with antibody to the basement mem-brane of the lung and kidney (e.g., Goodpasture syndrome), pulmonary hemosiderosis associated with hypersensitivity to proteins in cow\\'s milk (Heiner syndrome), and idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH).\\nGoodpasture syndrome is characterized by linear immunofluorescence \\ndeposition of immunoglobulin and complement along the basement mem-brane of the lung tissue and the kidney glomeruli and is associated with vascular damage and diffuse defragmentation of the basement membrane on electron microscopy or is immune complex disease. Idiopathic pul-monary hemosiderosis is morphologically characterized by intra-alveolar hemorrhage and subsequent abnormal accumulation of iron in the form of hemosiderin inside pulmonary macrophages. Recurrent episodes of hem-\\n\\n134\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEorrhage lead to thickening of the alveolar basement membrane and inter-\\nstitial fibrosis.\\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare lung disorder of \\nunknown etiology characterized by alveolar filling derived from surfactant phospholipids and protein. There are two forms of PAP primary (idio-pathic) and secondary. PAP develops due to lung infections, hematologic \\nmalignancies and inhalation of mineral dusts such as silica, titanium oxide, aluminum, indium-tin oxide and insecticides. The incidence of PAP is increased in patients with hematologic malignancies and AIDS, suggesting a relationship with immune dysfunction. In pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) the alveoli are filled with proteinaceous material, which has been analyzed extensively and determined to be normal surfactant composed of lipids and surfactant-associated proteins A, B, C, and D (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, SP-D. Patients with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) typi-cally present with a gradual onset of symptoms. About 30% of patients are asymptomatic, with diffuse chest radiograph abnormalities. The symptoms include the following: persistent dry cough, progressive dyspnea, fatigue, weight loss, fever and/or night sweats.\\nSerologic studies are generally not useful for pulmonary alveolar pro-\\nteinosis (PAP). Flexible bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) remains the standard criteria. Elevated levels of the proteins SP-A and SP-D in serum and BAL fluid may be useful. Elevated titer of neutralizing autoantibody. Chest radiography in pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) shows bilateral perihilar infiltrates with consolidation in a \"bat-wing\" con-figuration, which may mimic pulmonary edema, although with a typical absence of cardiomegaly or pleural effusion. Unilateral involvement occurs occasionally, and lymphadenopathy is rarely present. \\nHigh-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the chest \\ndemonstrates areas of patchy ground-glass opacification with smooth inter-lobular septal thickening and intralobular interstitial thickening, which produces a polygonal pattern referred to as \"crazy paving.\" The crazy-pav-ing pattern can also be observed in exogenous lipoid pneumonia, sarcoido-sis, mucinous bronchoalveolar cell carcinoma, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\\n\\xa0 Lung biopsy findings are typical for PAP . Alveoli are \\nfilled with nonfoamy material. Transbronchial biopsies are adequate, and open lung biopsy is not required.\\nGenetic diseases: Gaucher disease is a lipid storage disease character-\\nized by the deposition of glucocerebroside in cells of the macrophage-mono-\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE135\\ncyte system. The disorder results from the deficiency of a specific lysosomal \\nhydrolase, glucocerebrosidase. The disease is characterized by a continuum of phenotypes. The severity widely varies. Some patients present with virtu-ally all the complications of Gaucher disease in childhood, whereas others remain asymptomatic into the eighth decade of life.\\nGaucher disease has traditionally been divided into the following \\n3 clinical subtypes, delineated by the absence or presence of neurologic involvement and its progression:\\n• Type 1 – Nonneuronopathic form\\n• Type 2 – Acute neuronopathic form\\n• Type 3 – Chronic neuronopathic form\\nGlucosylceramide, the accumulated glycolipid, is primarily derived from \\nthe phagocytosis and degradation of senescent leukocytes and, to a lesser extent, from erythrocyte membranes. The glycolipid storage gives rise to the characteristic Gaucher cells, macrophages engorged with lipid with a crumpled–tissue-paper appearance and displaced nuclei. The factors that contribute to the neurologic involvement in patients with types 2 and 3 disease are still unknown but may be related to the accumulation of a cyto-toxic glycolipid, glucosylsphingosine, in the brain due to the severe defi-ciency of glucocerebrosidase activity or to neuroinflammation.\\nGlucosylceramide accumulation in the bone marrow, liver, spleen, lungs, \\nand other organs contributes to pancytopenia, massive hepatosplenomeg-aly, and, at times, diffuse infiltrative pulmonary disease. The diagnosis can be confirmed through the measurement of glucocerebrosidase activity in peripheral blood leukocytes. A finding of less than 15% of mean normal activity is diagnostic. MRI may be useful in delineating the degree of mar-row infiltration and evaluating spinal involvement. Skeletal radiography can be used to detect and evaluate skeletal manifestations of Gaucher disease. Chest radiography is done to evaluate pulmonary manifestations. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) is useful in evaluating osteo-penia. Bone scans may be useful in diagnosing bone crises.\\nNewmann-Pick disease refers to autosomal recessive lysosomal storage \\ndisorders due to acid sphingomyelinase deficiency (Niemann–Pick disease, types A and B) or defective cholesterol esterification (Niemann–Pick dis-ease, types C and D). The Niemann–Pick disease group is now divided into two distinct entities: (1) acid sphingomyelinase-deficient Niemann–Pick disease (ASM-deficient NPD) resulting from mutations in the SMPD1 gene and encompassing type A and type B as well as intermediate forms;'),\n",

Nosocomial fever is a fever occurring on several \\noccasions in a patient hospitalized for at least 24 hours and without any \\nmanifestation of an obvious source of infection that could have been pres-\\nent before the admission. A minimum of three days of evaluation without establishing the cause of fever is required to make this diagnosis. It requires special attention to all intravascular devices, previous surgical procedure \\nsites, evidence of pneumonia, and medications.\\nConditions causing nosocomial FUO include:\\n• septic thrombophlebitis,\\n• pulmonary embolism,\\n• Clostridium difficile enterocolitis,\\n• drug-induced fever.\\nIn patients with nasogastric or nasotracheal tubes, sinusitis may also be \\na cause. The most common causes of nosocomial FUO include pneumonia, \\nurinary tract infection, surgical site infection, catheter-related infections, \\nClostridium difficile colitis, and drugs.\\nThe differential diagnostic spectrum of the causes of feveris changed in the \\npresence of an underlying disease (neutropenia, HIV infection, endoprosthe-ses) or a specific epidemiological situation (nosocomial infection, following a stay in, or return from endemic regions, with specific infectious diseases).\\nImmune-deficient FUO (neutropenic FUO). It is a recurrent fever \\nin a patient whose neutrophil count is 500 per mm3 or less and who has been assessed for three days without detection an etiology for the fever. In most of these cases, the fever is caused by opportunistic bacterial infections. These patients are usually treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics to cover \\nthe most likely pathogens. Occult infections caused by fungi, such as hepat-\\nosplenic candidiasis and aspergillosis, must be considered. Less commonly, herpes simplex virus may be the inciting organism, but this infection tends \\nto present with characteristic skin findings\\nChronic mercury intoxication. The differential diagnosis should also \\nconsider chronic mercury poisoning. Persons with a long-term and con-centrated exposure to mercury vapors in industry and certain laboratories \\ncan present with the following symptoms: loss of appetite, weight loss, gas-tric symptoms, sleeplessness, increased salivation, stomatitis, diarrhea, fine tremor of the hands, eyelids, lips, and tongue, ataxia, dysarthria, mental \\ndisorders (depression, irritability, anxiety, exaggerated emotional reactions), \\nand vegetative disorders (dermographism, blushing and turning pale, sweating).

Thrombosis, phlebitis, \\nand thromboembolisms can be accompanied by fever even in the absence \\nof any significant clinical findings. Of these, especially recurrent pulmo-nary embolisms are of great practical significance.After long-term infusion therapy, thrombophlebitis frequently occurs in the arms. In these cases the differential diagnosis must also exclude endoplastitis with bacteremia or septicemia.\\nFactitious fever or simulated fever is usually recognized in persons \\nwith psychosocial or psychiatric problems by the atypical course and the disproportion between the magnitude of the temperature and the pulse rate.The evidence of psychiatric problems or a history of multiple hospital-izations at different institutions is common in patients with factitious fever.\\nRapid changes of body temperature without associated shivering or \\nsweating, large differences between rectal and oral temperature, and dis-crepancies between fever, pulse rate, or general appearance are typically observed in patients who manipulate or exchange their thermometers, that is the most common cause of factitious fever.

Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) affects 2-10% of \\nall populations studied; 75-95% of patients are women with a prevalence \\nbetween the ages of 30 and 50. Doctors will meet patients with ﬁbromy-algia in a variety of settings. There are similarities between patients with ﬁbromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalopathy (ME), multiple chemical sensitivities and depression (or their parents), 60% of recall childhood growing pains (leg pains). Fibromyalgia is associated with psychosocial stress.\\nDEFINITION. The generalized form of soft tissue rheumatism is \\ncalled fibromyalgia. Older synonyms include fibrositis, tension myalgia, generalized nonarticular rheumatism, and psychogenic rheumatism.\\nCLASSIFICATION. The problem of classifying chronic bodily \\ncomplaints without any clearly demonstrable physical lesion (functional somatic syndromes) is common to all medical specialties. Chapter XIII the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), which is entitled „Diseases of the musculoskeletal system and connective tissue” contains the heading M79, „other soft tissue disorders, not elsewhere classified” under which „fibromyalgia” is found as item M79.7. The guideline recommends classifying FMS as a functional somatic syndrome rather than a mental disorder.\\nPrimary – genetic FMS. Individuals with the 5-HT2A receptor 102T/C \\npolymorphism have been found to be at increased risk of developing fibro-myalgia.\\nSecondary FMS – may be associated with irritable bowel syndrome, irri-\\ntable bladder syndrome, chronic headaches, mood disorders (depression, anxiety), sleep disorders, paraneoplastic syndrome.\\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY. Fibromyalgia is a multifactorial syndrome \\ncharacterized by abnormal processing of pain, known as „central sensiti-zation”. It is potentially associated with polymorphisms of genes in the serotoninergic, dopaminergic and catecholaminergic systems. Patients have a lower pain threshold due to increased reactivity of pain-sensitive nerve cells in the spinal cord or brain. In this process neuronal pain pathways originally activated from an identiﬁable noxious source become activated later in the absence of clear stimuli.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE391\\nThere are several hypotheses about the way fibromyalgia develops:\\n• Genetic predisposition to pain sensitivity\\n• Neuroendocrine disturbance\\n• Neurotransmitter regulation\\n• Abnormal pain processing\\n• Autonomic nervous system dysfunction\\n• Sleep physiology– Lack of stage 4 sleep\\n• Muscle pathology -Changes in regulation of intramuscular micro-circulation; decrease in energy – rich phosphates\\n• Allergy, infection, toxicity and nutritional deﬁciency\\n• Psychosomatic\\n• Trauma – whiplash \\nClinical Findings. Fibromyalgia syndrome is characterized by:• widespread, symmetrical, diffuse pains of characteristic tender points of muscles and muscle insertions and hyperalgesic tender spots along. Patients localize the pain poorly, referring it to muscle attachment sites or muscles, temporomandibular joint symptoms, pelvic pain\\n• subjective joint swelling (without objective synovitis on examina-tion), arthralgia. \\n• pain and tenderness tend to come and go, and move about the body\\n• morning stiffness, but it is usually not as long or as severe as in patients with inflammatory arthritis\\n• multiple somatic visceral symptoms: urinary irritability, an irritable colon\\n• fatigue, anxiety,\\n• paresthesia\\n• headache,\\n• depression.\\n• sleep disturbance (nonrestorative, non-restful sleep)\\n• other physical and psychological symptoms,\\n• The discomfort may be worse late in the day after activity or is asso-ciated with psychosocial stress.\\n• Physical activity or changes in the weather typically aggravate the symptoms\\n• There is no progressive physical disability; however, patients may feel that they are unable to function normally.\\nThe typical patient will tend to be female, aged 30 – 50 years, with long– \\nstanding diffuse pain. She will often have a history of physical or psycho-\\n\\n392\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINElogical trauma, and this may have been related to previous abuse. She will \\ndescribe a fatigue on waking. The symptoms are always present but are exacerbated by other stressors in her life. She may have experienced rejec-tion by other doctors who investigated but did not ﬁnd any organic cause of the symptoms. This rejection can lead to more anxiety and hence intensiﬁ-cation of the symptoms. The patient may also have become depressed if her symptoms have not been helped by previous interventions. The examina-tion of such a patient reveal tender hyperalgesic sites and the patient visibly winces when they are pressed.\\nDiagnosis. A detailed history and careful physical examination exclude \\nmost rheumatologic and neurologic diseases. The finding of painful points at muscle attachment sites supports the diagnosis of fibromyalgia, the pain should be present for at least 3 months and should involve areas on both sides of the body above. The tender points usually are clearly delineated in a symmet-rical manner. Other points examined for comparison are less, or not, tender (for example other muscles, clavicula). These control points are important in the delineation of general pain syndromes and other expressions of pain\\nThe diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology \\n(ACR) have gained worldwide acceptance as the prevailing definition of FMS. These criteria define FMS as chronic pain (i.e., pain for more than 3 months) in multiple parts of the body.\\nAmerican College of Rheumatology diagnosis criteria of ﬁbromyal-\\ngia (1990)\\n• Widespread musculoskeletal pain in all four quadrants of the body and some axial pain (cervical spine, anterior chest, thoracic spine or low back) present for at least 3 months\\n• Hyperalgesic points positive on digital pressure of 4 kg in 11 out of 18 points on the ﬁgure (hyperalgesia is absent in other control areas of the body, e.g. forehead)\\n• The points are all bilateral and situated in:– The suboccipital muscle insertions at the base of the skull\\n– The low cervical spine C5 – 7 interspinous ligaments\\n– The trapezius muscles at the midpoint of the upper border\\n– The supraspinatus muscle originating above the scapulae spines\\n– The second costochondral junctions on the upper surface lateral to the junction in 2cm distaly to the lateral epicondyles\\n– The upper outer quadrants of the buttocks in the anterior fold of the gluteus medius\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE393\\n– The greater trochanters posterior to the trochanteric prominence\\n– medial fat pads of the knee proximal to the joint line ABC\\nThe revised criteria use the widespread pain index (WPI) and the symp-\\ntom severity scale (SS) in place of tender point testing under the 1990 \\ncriteria. The WPI counts up to 19 general body areas in which the person has experienced pain in the preceding two weeks. The SS rates the severity of the person\\'s fatigue, unrefreshed waking, cognitive symptoms, and gen-eral somatic symptoms, each on a scale from 0 to 3, for a composite score ranging from 0 to 12. WPI ≥ 7 and SS ≥ 5 OR WPI 3–6 and SS ≥ 9. The symptoms have been present at a similar level for at least three months, and no other diagnosable disorder otherwise explains the pain.\\nLaboratory evaluation There is no diagnostic test for fibromyalgia. \\nLaboratory and radiologic findings are normal, but the following tests are recommended for the differential diagnosis and exclusion of other serious conditions:\\n• a complete blood count,\\n• erythrocyte sedimentation rate, ESR,\\n• thyroid function studies TSH\\n• electrolytes– Ca, Mg, Potassium,\\n• Cr, Phosphorus(PO4)\\n• urea, creatinine,\\n• liver function.\\n• alkaline phosphatase\\n• In selected cases, if liver transaminase values are increased, then cre-atinekinase and hepatitis serologic tests may be indicated.\\n• Radiographs– for excluding other diseases.\\n• Sleep studies -if sleep disturbance is prominent (patients with sleep apnea have fibromyalgia symptoms):\\n• the presence of anomalous alpha wave activity (typically associated with arousal states) measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) dur-ing non-rapid eye movement sleep of \"fibrositis syndrome\". \\nNeuroimaging:• decreased levels of N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) in the hippocampus of people with fibromyalgia, indicating decreased neuron function-ality in this region.\\n• Altered connectivity and decreased grey matter of the default mode network, the insula, and executive attention network have been found in fibromyalgia.\\n\\n394\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE• Increased levels of glutamate and glutamine have been observed in \\nthe amygdala, the parts of the prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingu-\\nlate cortex, and the insula, correlating with pain levels in FM.\\n• Decreased GABA has been observed in the anterior insular in fibro-\\nmyalgia. resting functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI)\\nfMRI study – Resting functional connectivity magnetic resonance \\nimaging (fcMRI) is a recent adaptation of fMRI that examines intrinsic connectivity defined as synchronous oscillations of the fMRI signal that occurs in the resting basal state.\\n• Increased cerebral blood flow in response to pain was found\\n• Findings of decreased blood flow in the thalamus and other regions of the basal ganglia correlating with treatment have been relatively consistent over three studies.\\n• Decreased binding of µ-opioid receptor have been observed, how-\\never it is unknown if this is a result of increased endogenous binding in response to pain, or down regulation.\\nDifferential diagnosis of diffuse body pain fibromyalgiaCommon causes of body pain fibromyalgia:• systemic lupus erythematosus\\n• Sjögren syndrome,\\n• non-celiac gluten sensitivity,\\n• hypothyroidism,\\n• ankylosing spondylitis,\\n• polymyalgia rheumatica,\\n• rheumatoid arthritis,\\n• psoriatic-related polyenthesitis,\\n• hepatitis C,\\n• peripheral neuropathies,\\n• multiple sclerosis,\\n• disorders of the spine,\\n• myopathies,\\n• drug –induced causes,\\n• myofascial pain syndrome (more localized)\\n• disorders of subcutaneous connective tissue: panniculosis or pan-\\nniculitis\\n• pancreatic diseases\\n• sarcoidosis.\\n• psychiatric: depression.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE395\\nTable 34 \\nPhysical and psychological associations with ﬁbromyalgia\\nPhysical Psychological\\nIrritable bladder Panic attacks \\nIrritable bowel Anxiety\\n Migraine Depression\\nMuscle spasm  Irritability \\nDizziness Memory lapses\\nPerception of swelling Word mix – ups \\nParaesthesiae Reduced concentration\\nTemperature changes \\nFatigue \\nPersistent somatoform pain disorder. 40% to 70% of patients can be \\nfound to have relevant emotional or psychosocial conflicts that are tempo-\\nrally related to the appearance or intensification of the painful symptoms. About 60% of the patients spontaneously report having such conflicts.\\nAffective disorders and anxiety disorders. Depending on the level of care \\nand the criteria and diagnostic instruments that are applied, the prevalence of affective disorders in patients with FMS is 20% to 80%, while that of anxiety disorders is 15% to 65%.\\nPolysymptomatic functional somatic syndrome. Depending on the level \\nof care and the criteria and diagnostic instruments that are applied, the prevalence of other functional somatic syndromes (FSS), such as irritable bowel syndrome or chronic fatigue syndrome, in patients with FMS ranges from 20% to 80%.\\nOther symptoms often attributed to fibromyalgia that may be due to \\na comorbid disorder include myofascial pain syndrome, also referred to as chronic myofascial pain, diffuse non-dermatomal paresthesias, functional bowel disturbances and irritable bowel syndrome, genitourinary symptoms and interstitial cystitis, dermatological disorders, headaches, myoclonic twitches, and symptomatic hypoglycemia. Although fibromyalgia is clas-sified based on the presence of chronic widespread pain, pain may also be localized in areas such as the shoulders, neck, low back, hips, or other areas. Many sufferers also experience varying degrees of myofascial pain and have high rates of comorbid temporomandibular joint dysfunction. 20–30% of people with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus may also have fibromyalgia.\\nMultiple sclerosis. Patients with multiple sclerosis have neurological\\n\\n396\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEsymptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems. The \\nspecific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sen-sation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel diffi-culties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff\\'s phenomenon, worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte\\'s sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are characteristic. Some relapses are preceded by com-mon triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer; viral infections such as cold, influenza, or gastroenteritis increase their risk. Stress may also trigger an attack.\\nNon-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is the most common syndrome \\nof gluten-related disorders with prevalence rates between 0.5–13% in the general population. It is defined as „a clinical entity induced by the inges-tion of gluten leading to intestinal and/or extraintestinal symptoms that improve once the gluten-containing foodstuff is removed from the diet, and celiac disease and wheat allergy have been excluded”. The diagnos-tic criteria of non-celiac gluten sensitivity were debated. In the „classical” presentation of NCGS, gastrointestinal symptoms are similar to those of irritable bowel syndrome, and are also not distinguishable from those of wheat allergy, but there is a different interval between exposure to wheat and onset of symptoms. Wheat allergy has a fast onset (from minutes to hours) after the consumption of food containing wheat and can be ana-phylaxic. Gastrointestinal symptoms include any of the following: abdom-inal pain, bloating, bowel habit abnormalities (either diarrhea or consti-pation), nausea, aerophagia, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and aphthous stomatitis. Extraintestinal symptoms, which can be the only manifestation of NCGS in the absence of gastrointestinal symptoms include any of the following: headache, migraine, „foggy mind”, fatigue, fibromyalgia, joint and muscle pain, leg or arm numbness, tingling of the extremities, derma-titis (eczema or skin rash), atopic disorders such as asthma, rhinitis, other allergies, depression, anxiety, iron-deficiency anemia, folate deficiency, or autoimmune diseases. NCGS has also been controversially implicated\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE397\\nin some neurological and psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, \\nautism, peripheral neuropathy, ataxia, attention deficit hyperactivity disor-der (ADHD), and hallucinations (so-called „gluten psychosis”). Fibromy-algia has also been linked with bipolar disorder, particularly the hypomania component.\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\n1. Aziz I., Hadjivassiliou M., Sanders D.S.

Connective tissue diseases are autoimmune (autoin-\\nflammatory) rheumatic disorders and include the following entities such \\nas systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic scle-rosis, vasculitis and inflammatory myopathies. They are multisystem disor-ders with multi-organ implication and frequent clinical manifestations are complex and varied. In general, the number and severity of the extra-artic-ular features vary with the duration and severity of disease.\\nConnective tissue diseases:• Systemic lupus erythematous,\\n• Systemic sclerosis\\n• Sjögren’s syndrome\\n• Dermatomyositis / polymyositis,\\n• Vasculitis\\nTable 35\\nVisceral implication in autoinflammatory disease\\nSLE Systemic sclerosis Sjögren’s \\nsyndromeInflammatory myopathies Vascu-litis\\nSkin 81% 95% 13-20% 30% 50-70%\\nLungs 50% >70% 25% 70%\\nHeart 33% 70% 25% 20% 25-70%\\nDigestive tract 30% Esophagus – 90%,Small Intestine – 20-50%,colon – 10-50%25-50% 25% 30-60%\\nRenal 70% 10-15% 5-10% 20-40% 35-60%\\nNervous system54% 10% 70% 50% 75%\\nVisceral manifestations in systemic lupus erythematous\\nPulmonary manifestations. In SLE pulmonary involvement is mani-\\nfested by any of the following: pleuritis – 50%, pleural effusions, bron-chopneumonia and pneumonitis are frequent, pulmonary hypertension, hemorrhage, and diaphragmatic dysfunction, pulmonary embolism also may occur. Restrictive lung disease can develop. Alveolar hemorrhage is uncommon but life-threatening. Interstitial lung disease is rare. Shrinking\\n\\n400\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINElung syndrome (dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, progressive reduction in lung \\nvolume, elevated diaphragms) is possible.\\nCardiac manifestations. In SLE cardiac involvement is frequent. The \\npericardium is affected in the majority of patients and is manifested by pericarditis; it may be episodic, isolated or recurrent, more frequently in the onset of the disease. The amount of fluid is reduced without haemodynamic disturbances. It is exudate and anti DNAdc also may be present. Myo-carditis is also relatively frequent with arrhythmias, valvular involvement, cardiac failure and accelerated coronary atherosclerosis, coronary vasculi-tis. Libman-Sacks endocarditis is described with mitral and aortic valves implication. It is usually clinically silent but occasionally can produce acute or chronic valvular regurgitation – most commonly mitral regurgitation. Coronary arteritis with clinical picture of angina or myocardial infarction may also occur. Heart failure may result from myocarditis and hyperten-sion.\\nRenal manifestations may be present at the onset of the disease. Some-\\ntimes asymptomatic manifestations occur through edema after the installa-tion of nephrotic syndrome or renal insufficiency. The type of lupus nephri-tis is shown in Table 36.\\nTable 36\\nWHO classification of lupus nephritis\\nnormal (class I) asymptomatic \\nmesangial proliferative (class II) mild hematuria or proteinuria \\nfocal proliferative (class III) nephritic syndrome, proteinuria \\ndiffuse proliferative (class IV) nephritic syndrome, nephrotic syndrome \\nmembranous glomerulonephritis \\n(class V)nephrotic syndrome \\nglomerulosclerosis (class VI) uremia \\nSeverity VI >IV >III >V >II >I consider aggressive treatment for class III, IV \\nGastrointestinal manifestations: Mesenteric thrombosis and vascu-\\nlitis, occasionally occur in SLE including the presence of aneurysms in \\nmedium-sized blood vessels and may closely resemble polyarteritis nodosa. Hepatitis/ hepatopathy with high level of transaminases may also develop. Abdominal pain (particularly postprandial), ileus, peritonitis/ peritoneal serositis, and perforation may result. Corticosteroids could increase the risk of peptic ulcer disease. The presence of persistent peritoneal effusion is the consequence of imbalances in colloidosmotic pressure from congestive\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE401\\nheart failure, nephrotic syndrome or cirrhosis.The acute surgical abdomen \\nof lupus disease is due to intestinal vasculitis. Intestinal vasculitis can also induce digestive haemorrhages, intraperitoneal haemorrhage and intestinal perforation. Lupus pancreatitis is due to arteriitis and/or other vascular lesions, pancreatic infarction and corticosteroid therapy. Hepatitis is also present and may be viral or secondary to treatment.\\nAntiphospholipid syndrome is responsible for thrombosis in different \\ntopographic areas with hepatic, splenic or intestinal infarctions.\\nHematologic manifestations include moderate anemia, inflammatory \\ntype, reticulocytosis, leucopenia, sometimes thrombocytopenia, pancytope-nia. Anemia is usually haemolytic, with a positive Coombs test. Iron defi-ciency may be secondary to bleeding or nephrotic syndrome.\\nNeurologic complications of SLE: central nervous system lupus is a \\nmost variable and unpredictable phenomenon.\\nManifestations such as:• depression\\n• psychosis,\\n• impaired cognitive function, seizures\\n• migraine like attacks\\n• long tract signs,\\n• stroke\\n• aseptic meningitis,\\n• transverse myelitis\\n• organic brain syndrome\\n• peripheral and cranial neuropathy\\noccur with little apparent relationship to each other or to other systemic \\nmanifestations. Severe depression and psychosis are sometimes exacerbated by the administration of large doses of corticosteroids. When there is doubt about the cause of psychosis in patients with SLE, the steroid dose can be increased and the patient observed. Patients rarely can have isolated cen-tral nervous system involvement and normal results of cerebrospinal fluid examination and no other organ involvement. Secondary cause particularly with neuropsychiatric symptoms or respiratory symptoms must be consid-ered, especially infection, hypertension, anemia, hypoxia, and fever. Fever should be considered due to infection until proved otherwise.\\nDiagnosis of nervous system implications:– increased cerebrospinal fluid protein (IgG),\\n– pleocytosis, and\\n\\n402\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE– antineuronal antibodies.\\n– Immune complexes in the choroid plexus are not specific for central \\nnervous system disease because they also occur in patients without central nervous system disease.\\n– electroencephalography can be abnormal.\\n– MRI shows areas of increased signal in the periventricular white matter, similar to those found in multiple sclerosis. Magnetic res-onance imaging findings are often nonspecific and sometimes can be seen in patients who have SLE without central nervous system manifestations\\nOcular manifestations include conjunctivitis, photophobia, transient or \\npermanent monocular blindness, and blurring of vision. Cotton-wool spots on the retina (cytoid bodies) represent the degeneration of nerve fibers due to occlusion of retinal blood vessels.\\nDermatologic manifestations. Discoid SLE involves the face, scalp, and \\nextremities, photosensitivity, malar rash (nasolabial folds spared), discoid lupus (erythematous papules/plaques with central hypopigmentation, atrophic scarring involving scalp and exposed skin, mucosal ulcers (oral, vaginal, nasal septal), alopecia, livedo reticularis, palpable purpura, Ray-naud’s phenomenon. There is follicular plugging with atrophy leading to scarring. Subacute cutaneous SLE is a subset of SLE that primarily has skin involvement with psoriasiform or annular erythematous lesions. Patients may be negative for antinuclear antibodies but frequently are positive for antibodies to the extractable nuclear antigen SS-A (Ro).\\nSerologic changes.

A considerable decrease in diffusing capac-\\nity can be present with a normal chest radiograph. Diffuse interstitial fibro-\\nsis occurs in approximately 70% of patients and is the most common pul-monary abnormality. It also occurs in patients who have active alveolitis demonstrated by:\\n1) bronchopulmonary lavage,\\n2) high-resolution computed tomography showing ground-glass appearance without honeycombing, or\\n3) lung biopsy.\\nPneumopathy in sclerodermia are most likely to respond to prednisone \\nand cyclophosphamide therapy with improvement of pulmonary function.\\nPulmonary hypertension is more common in patients with CREST \\nvariant. Pleuritis (with effusion) is rare.\\nCardiac abnormalities occur in up to 70% of patients. Conduction \\ndefects and supraventricular arrhythmias are most common. Myocardial fibrosis and pericarditis may also be present. Pulmonary hypertension with cor pulmonale is the most serious problem.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE405\\nGastrointestinal manifestations. Esophageal dysfunction is the most fre-\\nquent gastrointestinal abnormality. It occurs in 90% of patients and often \\nis asymptomatic. Lower esophageal sphincter incompetence with acid reflux may produce esophageal strictures or ulcers. Small bowel hypomotil-ity may be associated with pseudo-obstruction, bowel dilatation, bacterial overgrowth, and malabsorption. Colonic dysmotility also occurs, and wide-mouthed diverticuli may be found. Medications to reduce acid production are important. Reduced esophageal motility may respond to therapy with metoclopramide, cisapride, or erythromycin.Treatment with tetracycline may be helpful, but promotility agents are less effective.\\nRenal involvement may result in fulminant hypertension, renal failure, \\nand death if not treated aggressively. Proteinuria, newly diagnosed mild hypertension, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, vascular changes on renal biopsy, and rapid progression of skin thickening may precede overt clinical findings of renal crisis. Renal involvement with hyperreninemia necessitates the use of angiotensin-convertingenzyme inhibitors. Aggres-sive early antihypertensive therapy can extend life expectancy.\\nSerologic tests include antibodies to topoisomerase I (anti SCI 70) seen \\nmore in diffuse systemic sclerosis and antibody to centromere seen more in CREST syndrome. \\nSjögren’s syndrome – is autoimmune disorder characterized by exocrine \\ngland dysfunction. Its common features include dry eyes, mouth, and skin; arthralgias, neuropathies, and fatigue.\\nSjögren’s syndrome strict criteria include:• Gritty or dry eyes,\\n• dry mouth for over 3 months.\\nPatient requires liquids to swallow dry food, frequent sips of water, \\nbecause obvious swelling of the salivary glands develops. Many patients develop arthralgias and fatigue along with severe sicca symptoms but do not strictly meet the criteria for the diagnosis. The terms „partial” or” incomplete” Sjögren’s syndrome is applied in these settings. These patients should be seen periodically to monitor for further evidence of classic Sjögren’s syndrome.\\nAffecting other glands is clinically expressed by reducing secretions.Respiratory system involvement. At the tracheobronchial level and \\nlungs: tracheobronchitis and pneumonia may occur. Secondary pleurisy is rare.\\nCardiac abnormalities occur in up to 10%-20% of patients. Conduction \\ndefects and supraventricular arrhythmias are most common.\\n\\n406\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEAt the digestive tract level – xerostomy, gastritis (hypoacidity, glandular \\natrophy) and pancreatitis (exocrine disorder) are reported.\\nRenal implications – tubulointerstitial nephropathy, distal tubular aci-\\ndosis, nephrocalcinosis; different types of glomerulopathy appear in the \\nevolution of the disease.\\nTable 39\\nExtraglandular involvement\\nArthritisarthralgias,\\nintermittent joint swelling, or synovitis, usually not associ-ated with deformities\\nRespiratory tract Chronic bronchitis \\nNeurologicSensory or motor peripheral neuropathy,  Cranial neuropathyCentral nervous system involvement has been characterized by paralysis, seizures, transverse myelopathy, encephalopa-thy, meningitis or dementia\\nEndocrine Antithyroid antibodies, altered thyroid function\\nGastrointestinalDysphagia, atrophic gastritis, acute or chronic pancreatitis, elevated liver enzymes\\nDermatologic Dryness, palpable purpura, nonpalpable purpura\\nRenalGlomerulonephritisInterstitial nephritisDistal or proximal renal tubular acidosisNephrogenic diabetes insipidus\\nHaematologicalLymphomas may develop in patients with Sjögren (7% of patients).\\nDiagnosis:\\n• positive Schirmer test\\n• rose bengal staining, or lissamine green staining\\n• lip biopsy may show inflammation of the salivary glands\\n• hypergammaglobulinemia\\n• positive for antinuclear antibodies, especially antibodies to SS-A (Ro) or SS-B (La), or rheumatoid factor.\\n• positive salivary scintigraphy, parotid sialography, or an unstimulated salivary flow assessment.\\nSecondary Sjogren’s syndrome can be found in association with other \\nconnective tissue diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, progressive sys-\\ntemic sclerosis, and systemic lupus erythematosus. In addition, character-\\nistic complications of the disease such as renal tubular acidosis, myopathy,\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE407\\nplasma cell dyscrasias and other organ implication are frequently encoun-\\ntered.\\nInflammatory myopathies\\nInflammatory myopathies include polymyositis, dermatomyositis, inclu-\\nsion body myositis. These three illnesses are characterized by inflammatory \\nlesions in the muscles. They are all associated with weakness.\\nPolymyositis/DermatomyositisThe classic criteria by Bohan and Peter published in 1975 include:• proximal muscle weakness in the arms, legs, and neck,\\n• inflammation,\\n• necrotic muscle biopsy,\\n• muscle enzyme elevations in the serum, and\\n• EMG abnormalities.\\nInclusion body myositis. No established criteria for diagnosing this con-\\ndition. It generally requires a muscle biopsy which reveals classic inclusion bodies. Presumed diagnosis can be made based on male gender, advanced age, distal (hand and finger) involvement, and poor response to therapy. Laboratory testing should reveal an elevation of creatine kinase and aldo-lase levels, as in polymyositis and dermatomyositis.\\nVasculitis\\nV asculitis is a clinicopathologic process characterized by inflammation \\nand damage of blood vessels. The vessel lumen is usually compromised, \\nand this is associated with ischemia of the tissues supplied by the involved vessel. A broad and heterogeneous group of syndromes may result from this \\nprocess (see Tab . 40).\\nVasculitis syndromes (adapted from Jennette J.C. et al: Arthritis Rheum 2013; 65:1)\\nPrimary Vasculitis Syndromes Secondary Vasculitis Syndromes\\nGranulomatosis with polyangiitis \\n(Wegener\\'s)Microscopic polyangiitisEosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Churg-Strauss)IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Schönlein) Cryoglobulinemic vasculitisPolyarteritis nodosaKawasaki diseaseGiant cell arteritisTakayasu arteritisBehçet\\'s diseaseVasculitis associated with probable eti-ologyDrug-induced vasculitisHepatitis C virus-associated cryoglobu-linemic vasculitisHepatitis B virus-associated vasculitisCancer-associated vasculitisVasculitis associated with systemicdiseases Lupus vasculitisRheumatoid vasculitis\\n\\n408\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINECogan\\'s syndrome\\nSingle organ vasculitisCutaneous leukocytoclastic angiitisCutaneous arteritisPrimary central nervous system vas-culitisIsolated aortitisSarcoid vasculitis\\nClassification. A major feature of vasculitic syndromes as a group is the \\nfact that there is a great deal of heterogeneity at the same time as there \\nis a considerable overlap among them. This heterogeneity and overlap in addition to a lack of understanding of the pathogenesis of these syndromes have been major impediments to the development of the coherent classifi-cation system for these diseases.\\nGeneral principles of diagnosis. The diagnosis of vasculitis is when \\nconsidered in any patient with an unexplained systemic illness. However, there are certain clinical abnormalities that when present alone or in com-bination should suggest a diagnosis of vasculitis:\\n• palpable purpura\\n• pulmonary infiltrates\\n• microscopic hematuria\\n• chronic inflammatory sinusitis\\n• mononeuritis multiplex\\n• unexplained ischemic events\\n• glomerulonephritis with evidence of multisystem disease.\\nA number of nonvasculitic diseases may also produce some or all of \\nthese abnormalities. Thus, the first step in the workup of a patient with suspected vasculitis is to exclude other diseases that produce clinical man-ifestations that can mimic vasculitis. It is particularly important to exclude infectious diseases with features that overlap those of vasculitis, especially if the patient\\'s clinical condition is deteriorating rapidly and empirical immunosuppressive treatment is being contemplated. Once diseases that mimic vasculitis have been excluded, the workup should follow a series of progressive steps that result in the diagnosis of vasculitis and determine the possible site of lesion.\\nThe determination of the site of biopsy should be performed based on \\nthe presence of clinical disease in the affected organ. Common sites where biopsies may be performed include the lung, kidney and skin. Other sites Table 40 (cont.)\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE409\\nsuch as the sural nerv, brain, testicle, and gastrointestinal tissues may also \\ndemonstrate features of vasculitis and be appropriate locations for biopsy when clinically affected.\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\n1.

Acute renal failure (ARF) or acute kidney injury \\n(AKI) is defined as a rapid decline in renal filtration function and is based \\non a rise in serum creatinine, retention of urea and other nitrogenous prod-ucts, the disturbance of extracellular volume and electrolytes, fall in urine output.This can occur in the setting of previously normal renal function or in patients with pre-existing renal disease. More recently it has been rec-ognized that even very small increase in serum creatinine is associated with adverse patient disease evolution.\\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY. There are three main mechanisms of ARF: \\nprerenal, intrinsic and postrenal (obstructive). In prerenal failure, glomer-ular filtration rate (GFR) is depressed by compromised renal perfusion. Tubular and glomerular functions remain normal.\\nSevere renal injury is the most common cause of intrinsic renal failure. \\nImpaired renal blood flow (RBF) due to different causes leads to ischemia and cell death. The initial ischemic episode provokes a cascade of events, including production of oxygen free radicals, cytokines and enzymes, endothelial activation and leukocyte adhesion and activation of coagulation agents. The damage of renal tubes results in disruption of tight junctions between cells, allowing leak of glomerular basal membrane, and produces the depressing effect on glomerular filtration rate (GFR). In addition, dying cells form obstructing casts in the tubules, which further decrease GFR and lead to oliguria. During this period of compromised renal blood flow, the kidneys are particularly vulnerable, especially, when iatrogenic renal injury is present.\\nAlthough these changes are observed predominantly in proximal \\ntubules, injury to the distal nephron can also be observed and may become obstructed by desquamated cells and casts. Intrarenal vasoconstriction, fol-lowed by renal ischemia is the dominant mechanism for reduced GFR in patients with AKI. These pathophysiologic mechanisms provoke a severe imbalance between the mediators of vasoconstriction and dilatation that result in intrarenal vasoconstriction. The vasoconstrictors include angio-tensin II, endothelin, thromboxane and adenosine. The vasodilators include prostaglandin I2 and endothelial-derived nitric oxide. High levels of vaso-constrictors and low levels of vasodilators cause continued hypoxia and\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE411\\ncell damage. Therefore, during recent years it has become evident that pro-\\nnounced medulary ischaemia makes an important contribution. \\nCLASSIFICATION. The classification of AKI was based on the Risk, \\nInjury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, End-stage (RIFLE 2004) criteria (Table 41).\\nTable 41\\nThe RIFLE classification of AKI\\nClass Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) Urine output\\nRisk ↑ Serum creatinine (SCr) × 1.5 or ↓ \\nGFR >25%<0.5 mL/kg/h × 6 h\\nInjury ↑ SCr × 2 or ↓ GFR >50% <0.5 mL/kg/h × 12 h\\nFailure ↑ SCr × 3 or ↓ GFR >75% or if base-line SCr ≥353.6 µmol/L(≥4 mg/dL) ↑ SCr>44.2 µmol/L(>0.5 mg/dL)<0.3 mL/kg/h × 24 h or anuria × 12 h\\nLoss of kidney functionComplete loss of kidney function >4 weeks\\nEnd-stage  kidney diseaseComplete loss of kidney function >3 months\\nA new classification of AKI by the Acute Kidney Injury Network \\n(AKIN) working group was proposed in 2007 (Table 42).\\nTable 42\\nThe AKIN classification/staging system of acute kidney injury\\nStage Serum creatinie (SCr) Urine output\\n1 ↑ SCr ≥26.5 µmol/L (≥0.3 mg/dL) or ↑SCr ≥150 a 200% (1.5 a 2×)<0.5 mL/kg/h (>6 h)\\n2 ↑ SCr>200 or 300% (>2 a 3×) <0.5 mL/kg/h (>12 h)\\n3 ↑ SCr>300% (>3×) or if baseline SCr ≥353.6 µmol/L (≥4 mg/dL) ↑SCr ≥44.2 µmol/L (≥0.5 mg/dL)<0.3 mL/kg/h (24 h) or anuria (12 h)\\nThe RIFLE criteria and AKIN classification resulted in the Kidney \\nDisease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) classification proposed in \\n2012 (Table 43).\\nAcute renal failure is also identified as prerenal AKI, renal intrinsec \\nAKI and postrenal AKI.\\n\\n412\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINETable 43\\nClassification of AKI (KDIGO)\\nAKI is defined as any of the following:\\n• Increase in serum creatinine by ≥0.3 mg/dl (≥26.5 µmol/l) within 48 h; or\\n• Increase in serum creatinine to ≥1.5 times baseline, which is known or pre-sumed to have occurred within the prior 7 days; or• Urine volume <0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 h.\\nAKI staging system:\\nAKI stage Serum creatinine criteria Urine output criteria\\nAKI stage I Increase of serum creatinine by ≥0.3 \\nmg/dl (≥26.4 µmol/L)Urine output <0.5 ml/kg/hFor 6–12 h Or\\nincrease to 1.5–1.9 times from baseline\\nAKI stage II Increase of serum creatinine to 2.0–2.9 \\ntimes from baselineUrine output <0.5 ml/kg/hFor ≥12 h\\nAKI stage III Increase of serum creatinine ≥3.0 times from baselineUrine output <0.3 ml/kg/hFor ≥24 h\\nOr Or\\nserum creatinine ≥4.0 mg/dl (≥354 µmol/L)anuria for ≥12 h\\nOr\\ntreatment with RRT\\nOr\\nin patients <18 years, decrease in esti-\\nmated GFR to <35 ml/min per 1.73 m\\n2\\nPrerenal kindey injury is the most common form of renal failure (>50%).\\nCauses of prerenal AKI:Hypovolemia (haemorrhage, vomiting, diarrhea, burns), renal losses \\n(excess of diuretics, polyuria)\\n1) Hypotension (cardiogenic shock, sepsis, anaphylaxis)\\n2) Edema (cardiac failure, nephrotic syndrome, liver cirrhosis)\\n3) Hepatorenal syndrome\\n4) Severe cardiac failure, arrhythmias, pulmonary embolus, acute myo-cardial infarction\\n5) Abdominal aortic aneurysm, renal artery stenosis or occlusion\\n6) Renal hypoperfusion due to administration of some medications (NSAIDs, selective cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin-II receptor antagonists).\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE413\\nCauses of intrinsic AKI:\\n1) Tubular injury: acute tubular necrosis, nephrotoxins (aminoglyco-sides, radiocontrast media, myoglobin, heavy metals, myeloma kid-ney etc)\\n2) Pyelonephritis\\n3) Glomerular disease: glomerulonephritis, thrombosis, haemolytic uraemic syndrome, eclampsia\\n4) Acute interstitial nephritis due to drugs, toxins, infections\\n5) Systemic diseases: vasculitis, polyarteritis nodosa, cryoglobulinae-mia, thrombotic microangiopathy\\nCauses of postrenal AKI:1) Retroperitoneal fibrosis\\n2) Radiation fibrosis\\n3) Tumours\\n4) Calculus\\n5) Urethral strictures\\n6) Prostatic hypertrophy\\n7) Papillary necrosis\\nCLINICAL FEATURES OF AKI\\nClinical examination of eyes in patients with AKI may reveal the following:1. Jaundice – in liver cirrhosis\\n2. Iritis, keratitis, uveitis, dry conjunctivae – in autoimmune vasculitis\\n3. Keratopathy due to hypercalcemia – in multiple myeloma\\n4. Atheroemboli: retinopathy (cholesterol microembolism) in diabetes mellitus and hypertension\\nThe presense of uveitis may indicate interstitial nephritis and necrotiz-\\ning vasculitis\\nOcular palsy may indicate ethylene glycol poisoning or necrotizing vas-\\nculitis\\nFindings suggestive of severe hypertension, atheroembolic disease and \\nendocarditis may be observed on careful examination of the eyes.\\nSkin examination may reveal the following in patients with AKI:1. Livedo reticularis, digital ischemia, butterfly rash – in SLE\\n2. Palpable purpura – in systemic vasculitis\\n3. Maculopapular rash – in allergic interstitial nephritis\\n4. Skin signs of intravenous drug abuse – in endocarditis\\n5.

Hemoptysis – in ANCA vasculitis, Goodpasture syndrome, Wege-ner granulomatosis\\n2.

Cardiac murmurs – in endocarditis\\n7. Pericardial friction rub – in uremic pericarditis\\n8. Increased jugulo-venous distention and rales– in heart failure\\nAbdominal examination may reveal: 1. Abdominal tenderness – in nephrolithiasis, renal artery thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, papillary necrosis\\n2. Urinary obstruction in pelvic masses, prostatic hypertrophy, dis-tended bladder\\nAbdominal examination findings can be useful in helping to detect \\nobstruction at the bladder outlet as the cause of renal failure, such obstruc-tion may be due to cancer or to an enlarged prostate.\\nThe presence of tense ascites can indicate elevated intraabdominal pres-\\nsure that can retard renal venous return and result in AKI. The presence of an epigastric bruit suggests renal vascular hypertension, which may predis-pose to acute renal failure.\\nDiagnosis and diagnostic accomplishment of AKIThe diagnosis of AKI is traditionally based on a rise in serum creatinine \\nand fall in urine output. These abnormalities have to persist for longer than\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE415\\n3 days. However, immediately after a kidney injury, urea and creatinine \\nlevels may be normal and the only sign of a kidney injury may be decreased urine production.\\nA number of new biomarkers were identifides as risc factors predicting \\nAKI in patients at risk for the disease. It is allowable that profound ren-ovascular constriction may cause subclinical tubular damage in at least a subset of nephrons, not detectable by urinary sodium, which is not sensitive enough to identify mild tubular epithelial damage.\\nAlthough in human urine around 50 enzymes were detected, several \\nof them are used for diagnostic purposes. Urinary lysosomal hydrolytic enzyme– N-acetyl-β-glicosaminidase (NAG) is released by lysosomes from the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in the renal proximal convoluted tubules. Gamma-glutamyltransferase and alkaline phosphatase are released by lysosomes from the cytoplasm of epithelial cells in the renal proximal tubule, too, and demonstrate a high activity in certain clinical states, being eliminated in tubular fluid.\\nAlpha-glucosidase is another enzyme localized in the cytoplasm of epi-\\nthelial cells of the brush border membrane of renal proximal tubule cells and its excessive secretion in urine was reported. Similarly, increased num-ber of cytoplasmic enzymes – lactate dehydrogenase and glutamate dehy-drogenase, synthesized in mitochondria determine renal tubular epithelial cell cytolysis.\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS OF AKI\\nA detailed and well-aimed history is crucial for the diagnosis of acute \\nkidney injury. Distinguishing AKI from chronic kidney disease is important.\\nFactors that suggest chronic kidney disease (CKD) include:1. Long duration of symptoms. A history of chronic symptoms— years of fatigue, weight loss, nocturia, sleep disturbance and pruritus;\\n2. Nocturia;\\n3. Absence of acute illness;\\n4. Anaemia, hyperphosphataemia, hypocalcaemia;\\n5. Reduced renal size and cortex/ parenchyma ratio on renal ultrasound (except in patients with diabetes and amyloidosis – renal size is pre-served).\\nThe classification of AKI as prerenal, intrinsic renal or postrenal failure-\\ncan help in differential diagnosis.\\nIn prerenal failure patients present with decreased urine output, dizzi-\\n\\n416\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEness, orthostatic hypotension, low fluid intake, gastroenteritis, volume loss \\nfrom vomiting, diarrhea or hemorrhage. Patients with advanced cardiac failure and compromised renal perfusion may present with orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.\\nIn intrinsic renal failure patients can present nephrotic syndrome, edema, \\nand hypertension that indicate a glomerular etiology for AKI. Acute tubu-lar necrosis should be suspected in any patient with hemorrhage, sepsis, drug overdose, surgery, diabetes mellitus associated with bacterial infec-tions (Table 44).\\nTable 44\\nCriteria for diagnosis of acute renal failure – prerenal azotemia  \\nand acute tubular necrosis\\nA. Acute renal failure\\n1. Azotemia—rapidly increasing blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine \\n(BUN>30 mg/dL and creatinine>1.5 mg/dL) with or without oliguria.\\n2. Serum creatinine increase in excess of 0.5 mg/dL in the preceding 2 days.\\nB. Criteria to differentiate acute tubular necrosis from prerenal azotemia\\n1. History (volume depletion, decreased cardiac output or vasodilation related \\nto sepsis, liver failure and anaphylaxis favor prerenal azotemia, while exogenous toxins such as medications, or endogenous toxins as in the case of myoglobin, or even prolonged renal hypoperfusion that became unresponsive to appropriate corrective measures or to high dose of loop diuretics).\\n2. Physical examination (blood pressure, heart rate, orthostatic changes, cardiac \\nsounds, pulmonary findings, presence of ascites or leg edema).\\n3. Findings of the urine analysis (urinary sediment undetected in prerenal fail-\\nure, presence of muddy brown granular casts in patients with ATN). Response to therapy should also be recorded.\\n4. Urinary indices evaluated at the time of consultation are:\\n– Urinary sodium (U\\nNa): UNa<15 mEq/L favors prerenal failure, while a value \\nhigher than 20 is consistent with ATN.\\n– Urinary to plasma creatinine ratio (U/PCr). U/PCr>20 is consistent with prere-\\nnal failure, while levels <15 suggest ATN.\\n– Fractional excretion of sodium (FENa). FENa<1% is suggestive of prerenal azo-\\ntemia, while levels>1% indicate the presence of ATN.\\n– Urinary sodium/potassium ratio (UNa/K; a reflection of prerenal conditions \\nwith associated hyperaldosteronism). If UNa/K is less than 1/4, this favors pre-\\nrenal azotemia.\\nA careful search for nephrotoxic agents should include a detailed list of \\nall current medications and recent exposure to radiologic contrast agents.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE417\\nPigment-induced AKI should be suspected in patients with possible rhab-\\ndomyolysis (muscular pain, recent coma, seizure, intoxication, excessive exercise) or hemolysis (recent blood transfusion).\\nExposure to toxic substances, such as ethyl alcohol or ethylene glycol, \\nmercury vapors, cadmium or other heavy metals have to be excluded.\\nPatients with fevers, rash, arthralgias and exposure to medications, \\nincluding NSAIDs and antibiotics are susceptible to allergic interstitial nephritis.\\nPostrenal kidney failure needs imagistic confirmation. It occurs in older \\nmen with prostatic obstruction, sometimes asymptomatic, because of the chronicity of their symptoms. A history of prior gynecologic surgery or abdominopelvic malignancy often can be helpful in elucidating the cause and level of postrenal obstruction in women. Flank pain and hematuria should raise a concern about renal calculi or papillary necrosis. The use of methotrexate, triamterene or sulfonamides implies the possibility that crystals of these medications have caused tubular obstruction.\\nUrine output role in differential diagnosisAbrupt anuria suggests acute and severe glomerulonephritis, embolic \\nrenal artery occlusion or acute urinary obstruction. The diminishing of urine output can be the cause of prostate enlargement, urethral stricture or bladder chronic obstruction.\\nApproximately 50-60% of all causes of AKI are nonoliguric. The changes \\nin urine output correlate poorly with changes in the glomerular filtration rate. Nevertheless, in the differential diagnosis of AKI the identification of anuria, oliguria, and nonoliguria may be useful:\\n• Anuria (< 100 mL/day) indicates total urinary tract obstruction, bilateral renal artery obstruction, renal cortical necrosis and severe rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis;\\n• Oliguria (100-400 mL/day) may indicate hepatorenal syndrome, myocardial infarction, prerenal kidney failure;\\n• Nonoliguria (>400 mL/day) is possible in case of acute interstitial nephritis, acute glomerulonephritis, partial obstructive nephropathy, acute toxic nephritis (radiocontrast-induced, nephrotoxic agents, ischemia), rhabdomyolysis.\\nSerologic tests in differential diagnosisIncreased rouleaux formation suggests multiple myeloma, the presence \\nof schistocytes – hemolytic uremic syndrome or thrombotic thrombocyto-penic purpura.\\n\\n418\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEThe presence of the following with related findings may help to define \\nthe etiology of AKI:\\n– Increased serum uric acid level – tumor lysis syndrome\\n– Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) – renal infarction\\n– Myoglobin or free hemoglobin – pigment nephropathy\\n– Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) – vasculitis\\n– Anti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibody – \\nGoodpasture syndrome\\n– Complement levels – nephritis in autoimmune disease (e.g., SLE)\\n– Antinuclear antibody (ANA) – SLE or other connective tissue dis-orders\\n– Hepatitis B and C virus markers – nephritis secondary to viral hep-atitis\\n– Antistreptolysin (ASLO) antibodies – streptococcal glomerulone-phritis.\\nUrinalysis in differential diagnosesIn the differential diagnosis of AKI the clinical utility of urine micros-\\ncopy may be increased by using a simple urinary evaluation based on the number of renal tubular epithelial cells and renal tubular granular casts. The presence of tubular cells and tubular cell casts, granular, brown casts in urine sediment are highly suggestive of tubular necrosis.\\nThe presence of white blood cells (WBCs) and WBC casts suggests \\npyelonephritis or acute interstitial nephritis. Eumorphic RBCs suggest bleeding along the collecting system. Dysmorphic RBCs or RBC casts indicate glomerular inflammation, suggesting glomerulonephritis.\\nThe dipstick assay may reveal significant proteinuria as a result of glo-\\nmerular injury. The presence of eosinophils, as visualized with Wright stain or Hansel stain, suggests interstitial nephritis and uric acid crystals may represent ATN associated with uric acid nephropathy.\\nUrine electrolyte findings can also serve the indicators of functioning \\nrenal tubules. The fractional excretion of sodium is the commonly used indicator. However, the interpretation of results from patients in nonolig-uric states, those with glomerulonephritis and those receiving or ingesting diuretics can be uncertain.\\nThe formula for calculating the FENa is:\\nFENa = (U\\nNa/PNa) / (UCr/PCr) × 100,\\nwhere UNa is sodium in urine; PNa is sodium in plasma; UCr is creatinine \\nin urine and PCr is creatinine in plasma.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE419\\nFENa is identified as the most effective non-invasive test for the differ-\\nential diagnosis of acute renal failure. A FENa of 1 classifies all entities into \\ntwo groups: FENa more than 1 (acute tubular necrosis, non-oliguric acute tubular necrosis and urinary tract obstruction) and less than 1 (prerenal azotemia and acute glomerulonephritis).\\nFinally, the most common differentials to consider in AKI contain the \\nfollowing:\\nPrerenal differentialsCardiorenal syndrome (CRS) is defined as a condition characterized \\nby the initiation and progression of renal insufficiency secondary to heart failure with negative effects of reduced renal function on the heart and circulation. The classification of CRS is a start point in its differential diag-nosis in AKI.\\nType 1 CRS reflects an abrupt worsening of cardiac function (e.g., acute \\ncardiogenic shock or decompensated congestive heart failure) leading to acute kidney injury.\\nType 2 CRS comprises chronic abnormalities in cardiac function (e.g., \\nchronic congestive heart failure) causing progressive chronic kidney disease.\\nType 3 CRS consists of an abrupt worsening of renal function, causing \\nacute cardiac dysfunction (heart failure, arrhythmia, ischemia).\\nType 4 CRS describes a state of chronic kidney disease (e.g., chronic \\nglomerular disease) contributing to decreased cardiac function, cardiac hypertrophy, and/or increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events.\\nType 5 CRS reflects a systemic condition (sepsis) causing both cardiac \\nand renal dysfunction.\\nHepatorenal syndrome (HRS) HRS is the development of renal fail-\\nure in patients with advanced chronic liver disease who have portal hyper-tension and ascites. The condition is almost always caused by cirrhosis of the liver. Actually, at least 40% of patients with cirrhosis and ascites will develop HRS during the natural history of their disease.\\nVolume depletion as a cause of AKI is probable in any of the following \\nconditions:history of vomiting, diarrhea, diuretic overuse, osmotic dieresis, hemorrhage, burns and reduced fluid intake.\\nSeptic systemic vasodilatation. Septic AKI is responsible for about 50% \\nof ARF in ICU. The incidence of severe sepsis depends on how acute organ dysfunction is defined and on whether that dysfunction is attributed to an underlying infection. The clinical manifestations of sepsis are highly vari-able, depending on the initial site of infection, causative organism and the\\n\\n420\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEpattern of acute organ dysfunction. The signs of both infection and organ \\ndysfunction may be subtle, and thus the most recent international consen-sus guidelines provide a long list of warning signs of incipient sepsis. Acute kidney injury frequently requires treatment with renal-replacement therapy.\\nAlcoholic ketoacidosis is a metabolic complication of alcohol use and \\nstarvation characterized by hyperketonemia and metabolic acidosis without significant hyperglycemia. Alcoholic ketoacidosis causes nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. The diagnosis is based on the history of alcohol use and findings of ketoacidosis without hyperglycemia. Patients report nau-sea, vomiting, pain in abdomen, tachypnoea, tachycardia and hypotension. This syndrome is rapidly reversible and, if taken care of it has a low mor-tality. The main differences between patients with diabetic ketoacidos is that patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis are usually alert and lucid despite the severity of the acidosis and marked ketonaemia. The greatest threats to patients with alcoholic ketoacidosis are marked reduction in extracellular fluid volume (resulting in shock and AKI), hypokalaemia, hypoglycaemia and acidosis.\\nDiabetic ketoacidosis. Acute kidney injury in diabetic ketoacidosis is \\nassociated with markers of volume depletion and severe acidosis. Acute kid-ney injury is of concern because it is associated with increased morbidity and mortality as well as increased risk of chronic renal disease. Predominant symptoms are nausea and vomiting, pronounced thirst, abdominal pain that may be severe. In AKI and diabetic ketoacidosis there is usually a clinical evidence of dehydration. If the dehydration is profound enough to cause a decrease in the circulating blood volume, a rapid heart rate and low blood pressure may be observed. In severe diabetic ketoacidosis breathing becomes rapid and of a deep, gasping character, called Kussmaul breathing, compli-cated with coma, features that are not typical for alcoholic ketoacidosis.\\nIntrinsic renal differentialsAcute tubular necrosis (ATN) is the most common cause of renal \\nacute kidney failure, caused either by ischemic events (hemorrhage, volume loss from gastrointestinal tract and kidney, burns, liquid sequestration, car-diogenic, anaphylactic, obstructive or septic shocks, disseminated intravas-cular coagulation) or nephrotoxic events (aminoglicosides, amphotericin B, radiocontrast media, cisplatin, tacrolimus, ifosfamide, foscarnet, pent-amidine, acyclovir, sulfa drugs, concomitant use of diuretics, ACE inhib-itors or angiotensin receptor blockers, myoglobinuria in rhabdomyolysis, hemoglobinuria in hemolysis, acute crystal-induced nephropathy, multiple\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE421\\nmyeloma). Clinical findings may include: oliguria, low jugular venous pres-\\nsure, loss of skin turgor, orthostatic hypotension, dry mucous membranes, tachycardia,), abdominal distension (in intra-abdominal compartment syndrome) and muscle tenderness (in rhabdomyolysis). In case of amino-glycoside-induced ATN specific features are as follows: nonoliguric renal failure with elevation in serum creatinine occurring 7-10 days after therapy, elevated FENa, wasting of potassium, calcium and magnesium. In case of tacrolimus and cyclosporine toxicity patients present with hypertension, hyperkalemia, urinary wasting of phosphate and magnesium. Foscarnet toxicity is associated with hypocalcemia, isofosfamide toxicity – with sig-nificant hypokalemia and pentamidine nephrotoxicity – with hypomagne-semia and hyperkalemia. Acyclovir leads to the formation of needle-shaped intratubular crystals viewed on microscopy.\\nChronic renal failure (CRF) is defined as either kidney damage or a \\ndecreased glomerular filtration rate of <60 ml/min/1.73m2 for 3 or more months comparing to ARF, which occurs suddenly or over a short period of time. ARF is usually reversible, but CRF is irreversible. Most common cause of ARF is hypovolaemia, but in CRF, common causes are chronic glomerulopathy and diabetic nephropathy. Other causes include chronic pyelonephritis, polycystic kidney disease, connective tissue disorders, and amyloidosis. Clinically the patients present with malaise, anorexia, itch-ing, vomiting, convulsions. The patient is investigated to make the diagno-sis, identify the stage of the disease and assess the complications. In ARF, patient usually presents with reduced urine output, but CFR can presents with constitutional symptoms or its long term complication.\\nUltrasound examination of the kidney shows small kidneys, reduced \\ncortical thickness, increased echogenecity. In CRF renal size may remain normal in patients with diabetic nephropathy, myeloma, adult polycystic kidney disease and in amyloidosis. In acute renal failure the impairment of renal function occurs suddenly or within a short period of time (days to weeks) in contrast to chronic renal failure, which is diagnosed it lasts than 3 months.\\nAcute versus chronic renal failure includes:In AKI1) Acute onset\\n2) Rapid reduction in urine output\\n3) Usually reversible\\n4) Tubular cell death and regeneration\\n\\n422\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEIn CRF\\n1) Progressive evolution\\n2) Not reversible\\n3) Nephron loss\\n4) 75% renal function can be lost before noticeable\\nAcute glomerulonephritis (AGN) comprises a specific set of renal \\ndiseases in which an immunologic mechanism triggers inflammation and proliferation of glomerular tissue results in damage to the basement mem-brane, mesangium or capillary endothelium. Patients with AGN and AKI may present with generalized edema, hypertension, severe proteinuria. In the differential diagnoses of glomerulonephritis and AKI we will discuss those glomerular diseases that are manifested with a nephritic syndrome with haematuria, proteinuria and impaired renal function together with hypertension, fluid overload, and oedema.\\nIn primary acute glomerulonephritis, disease is almost entirely restricted \\nto the kidneys (as in IgA nephropathy or post-streptococcal glomerulone-phritis), while in secondary acute glomerulonephritis it occurs in associa-tion with more diffuse inflammation (as in systemic lupus erythematosus or systemic vasculitis). Prompt diagnosis of glomerulonephritis and AKI is vital as patients with impaired renal function, hypertension, and urinary abnormalities may rapidly lose kidney function.\\nHemolytic uremic syndrome is the most common cause of acute kid-\\nney injury in children which develops after prodromal diarrhea caused by bacteria (S.dysenteriae, E.coli, S.typhi, C.jejuni, L.pneumophila), richettsial (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, microtatobiotes) and viral infections (HIV , Coxsackievirus, Echovirus, Influenza virus, Ebstein-Barr virus, Herpes sim-plex virus). It is characterized by progressive renal failure, microangiopathic nonimmune hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia and neurological abnor-malities (irritability, lethargy, seizures).\\nPostrenal differentialsObstructive nephrophathy and AKI are caused by obstruction of uri-\\nnary outflow and slowing of the tubular function and glomerular filtration rate. A close examination of patient is necessary. It can be identified by kidney, bladder scanning which will reveal a large amount of retained urine or by ultrasonography of the kidneys, which will show hydronephrosis.\\nExtrarenal obstruction includes prostate hypertrophy, neurogenic blad-\\nder, retroperitoneal fibrosis, prostate, bladder or cervical cancer, ureter stones. Intrarenal obstruction is caused by stones, clots and tumors of the kidney.\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE423\\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\\n1. Palevsky P ., Murray P .T., eds.

Edema is an accumulation of fluid in the intercellular \\ntissue, that results from an abnormal expansion in interstitial fluid volume \\nand it is generally not clinically apparent until the interstitial volume has \\nincreased by at least 2.5–3 liters.\\nThere are different medical terms for edema in specific areas or organs \\nof the body:\\n1) Hepatic edema is the excessive fluid accumulation in tissues due to a \\nliver dysfunction\\n2) Cardiac edema is the excessive fluid accumulation in tissues due to \\nheart failure\\n3) Renal edema is the excessive fluid accumulation in the body’s tissues \\ndue to kidney disease\\n4) Anasarca is the term for severe generalized edema\\n5) Ascites is the term for excessive fluid accumulation within the perito-\\nneal cavity\\n6) Pleural effusion is the term for edema in the pleural space\\n7) Pericardial effusion is edema in the pericardial space\\n8) Pulmonary edema is the term for edema within the lungs\\n9) Cerebral edema is the edema within the brain\\n10) Lymphedema is the excessive fluid that cannot be drained by the \\nlymphatic vessels\\nPATHOPHYSIOLOGY. The fluid between the interstitial and intra-\\nvascular spaces is regulated by the capillary hydrostatic pressure gradient \\nand the oncotic pressure gradient across the capillary.The accumulation of fluid occurs when local or systemic conditions disrupt this equilibrium. It \\nis useful to review some background pathophysiology of total body water: \\n67% is intracellular and 33% – extracellular. In extracellular water 25% is intravascular and 75% is interstitial.\\nThe regulation of fluid distribution between the intravascular and inter-\\nstitial spaces consists of a constant exchange of water and solutes at the arteriolar end of the capillaries. The water exchange includes the following:\\na) Fluid is returned from the interstitial space to the intravascular space at the venous end of the capillaries and via the lymphatics\\nb) The movement of fluid from the intravascular space to the interstit-\\nium occurs through capillary hydrostatic pressure that pushes the fluid out of the vessels. The interstitial oncotic pressure pulls the fluid\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE425\\ninto the interstitium and capillary permeability allows the fluid to \\nescape into the interstitium\\nc) The movement of fluid from the interstitium to the intravascular space occurs when the plasma oncotic pressure from plasma proteins pulls the fluid into the vascular space and the interstitial hydrostatic pressure pushes the fluid out of the interstitium\\nThe capillary hydrostatic pressure and the intravascular oncotic pressure \\nare the most important factors. A small gradient favors filtration. The dis-turbance of the pressure gradient includes:\\n1) An increase in the capillary hydrostatic pressure (increased renal sodium vascular space into the interstitium; the excess fluid is removed by the lymphatic system)\\n2) A decrease in the plasma oncotic pressure (hypoalbuminemia)\\n3) An increase in the capillary permeability (burns, angioedema)\\n4) Lymphatic obstruction\\n5) An increase in the interstitial oncotic pressure (myxedema)\\nIn this context the causes of edema can be different (systemic and local) \\nand they are systematized in Table 45.\\nTable 45\\nLocal and systemic causes of edema\\nCause of edema Regulation of fluid distribution\\nLocal causes\\nCellulitis Increased capillary permeability\\nChronic venous insufficiency Increased capillary permeability caused by local \\nvenous hypertension\\nDeep venous thrombosis Increased capillary permeability caused by local venous hypertension\\nLymphedema Primary and secondary lymphatic obstruction\\nLipedema Accumulation of fluid in adipose tissue\\nMay-Thurner syndrome (compression of the left iliac vein by right iliac artery)Increased capillary permeability caused by local venous hypertension from compression\\nSystemic causes\\nCardiac disease Increased capillary permeability from systemic \\nvenous hypertension; increased plasma volume\\nHepatic disease Increased capillary permeability from systemic venous hypertension; decreased plasma oncotic pressure, reduced protein synthesis\\n\\n426\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEMalabsorption/protein-calo-\\nrie malnutritionReduced protein synthesis leading to decreased plasma oncotic pressure\\nRenal disease Increased plasma volume; decreased plasma on-cotic pressure from protein loss\\nAllergic reaction, urticaria and angioedemaIncreased capillary permeability\\nObstructive sleep apnea Pulmonary hypertension resulting in increased capillary hydrostatic pressure\\nPregnancy and premenstrual edemaIncreased plasma volume\\nThe main derangement that leads to edema is a reduction of effective \\narterial volume. This reduction is caused by diminished cardiac output or \\nsystemic vascular resistance.\\nReduced effective arterial volume leads to physiologic activation that \\ntries to restore the volume. This response leads to the retention of salt and water. Hypovolemia causes the diminished blood flow to the juxtaglomer-ular cells in the kidney. This causes a cascade of renin release, angioten-sinogen and then angiotensin I, which is then converted to angiotensin II hypersecretion.This activation eventually leads to vasoconstriction on the renal efferent arterioles with resultant enhanced salt and water reabsorption in the kidneys. Angiotensin II enters the systemic circulation, stimulating aldosterone release in the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone will further enhance sodium reabsorption and potassium excretion and its release is increased in many edematous states such as heart failure, liver ascites, nephrotic syn-drome, renal failure (Figure 4).\\n364The main derangement that leads to edema is a reduction of effective arterial \\nvolume.

Pathophysiology of edema\\nIn non-pitting edemas (e.g., myxedema) the tissues are gradually filled with \\nwater-loving molecules such as hyaluronan, a carbohydrate-like molecule. These molecules are responsible for attracting fluid to the tissues. They absorb water and swell up to cause the edema. \\nNon-pitting edema may be also caused by certain disorders of the lymphatic sys-\\ntem such as lymphedema, a condition of the lymphatic circulation which may occur congenitally, after a mastectomy, or lymph node surgery. It occurs in lymphedema, where the lymphatic system breaks down and the lymph nodes swell up. The osmot-ic pressure generated by the swollen lymph nodes may be responsible for the push-ing of the fluids against the skin even when pressure is applied on the af fected area. Figure 4.

The osmotic pressure generated by the swol-len lymph nodes may be responsible for the pushing of the fluids against the skin even when pressure is applied on the affected area.\\nCLASSIFICATION OF EDEMA\\nPitting edema is detected by the presence of pitting after pressure is \\napplied to the edematous area.\\n– Grade 1 pitting edema: A pit of 2 mm or less, presents as slight pit-ting with no distortion. Pitting disappears immediately\\n– Grade 2pitting edema – A deeper pit measuring between 2 mm and 4 mm. and the pitting will disappear in 10 – 15 seconds\\n– Grade 3 pitting edema – A noticeably deep pit measuring between 4 mm and 6 mm. The area affected will look swollen. The indentation will take as long as 1 minute before it disappears\\n– Grade 4pitting edema – A very deep pit is seen which will last between 2 to 5 minutes before it disappears. It will measure 6 – 8 mm in depth and the edema will look gross and distorted\\nNon-pitting edema – Non-pitting edema usually affects the legs or \\narms. If the pressure applied to the skin does not result in a persistent indentation, this type of edema is referred to as non-pitting edema, when lymphedema or pretibial myxedema should be considered. \\nAccording to the distribution of edematous fluid edema is classified \\ninto:\\na) Local edema\\nb) Generalized edema.\\nLocal edema occurs in one organ or a part of the body (brain edema, \\npulmonary edema, etc.). In regional edema, the clinician should localize the area of swelling to help deduce where a region of venous or lymphatic obstruction is likely to be present or localized allergen exposure has occurred. As cellulitis also can manifest with regional edema, the assessment of the\\n\\n428\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEpatient for fever and local signs of inflammation is important. If the edema \\nis localized to the face, the patient should be carefully evaluated for concur-rent airway involvement, which can be life threatening. Generalized edema occurs in the whole body (cardiac edema, renal edema, ascites).\\nClinical considerations and differential diagnosis of edema\\nThe goals of the evaluation of a patient with edema include the determi -\\nnation of the underlying character of the edema (localized or generalized), and causes of edema, as it will guide both the evaluation and treatment. It is important to identify those conditions that are potentially life-threatening or have serious medical complications, although most causes of edema are limiting local disorders (Table 46).\\nTable 46\\nPathological status of edemaPathological \\nstatus\\nPulmonary \\nedema\\nCentral venous \\npressure\\nAscites\\nPeripheral ede-\\nma\\nAnasarca\\nPitting edema\\nNon-pitting \\nedema\\nRight heart failure> + + + +\\nLeft heart failure + >\\nLiver cirrhosis < + + +\\nNephrotic syndrome> + + + +\\nIdiopathic edema+\\nHypo- albuminema+ +\\nVenuos  insufficiency + +\\nDeep venous thrombosis+ +\\nMyxedema +\\nAllergic  reactions+\\nPotentially serious medical disorders also include anaphylaxis, \\nangioedema with laryngeal involvement, decreased cardiac output (espe-\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE429\\ncially as a result of myocarditis or restrictive pericarditis) and anuria in \\nhepatic and renal disease.\\nThe physical examination is focused on measuring growth parameters, \\nfull evaluation of the cardiovascular system, including vital signs. Find-ings of tachycardia, tachypnea, gallop, pulmonary rales or hepatomegaly are seen in patients with heart failure, tachypnea and rales alone may be indicative of pulmonary edema. Increased blood pressure levels may reflect hypervolemia resulting from acute or chronic renal failure, chronic glomer-ulonephritis.\\nThe following signs and symptoms are found in a variety of diseases that \\ncause edema:\\n1. A patient with diaphoresis, dyspnea on exertion and a history of heart disease may have edema secondary to cardiac failure. Findings of clinical examination include tachycardia, tachypnea, rales, hepato-megaly\\n2. A history of food allergies may present acutely with urticaria and angioedema after allergen exposure. If there is airway involvement, this is a medical emergency\\n3. A history of jaundice, steatorrhea or abdominal pain should point the clinician toward a diagnosis of chronic liver disease or a protein losing-enteropathy\\n4. A progressive anasarca with significant periorbital edema and edema of the face, but minimal systemic complaints, may suggest a possible nephrotic syndrome\\n5. Cola-colored urine with either generalized or facial edema strongly suggests acute glomerulonephritis. These patients may also have hypertension\\n6. Lymphangiosarcoma is a late complication of lymphedema. This was originally described in the lymphedematous arms of patients follow-ing radical mastectomy\\nAcute swelling of a limb over a period of less than 72 hours is more \\ncharacteristic of deep venous thromboses, cellulitis, trauma, or recent initi-ation of treatment with calcium channel blockers\\nUnilateral swelling from compression or compromise of venous or \\nlymphatic drainage can result from venous thrombosis, venous insuffi-ciency, venous obstruction by tumor, lymphatic obstruction or lymphatic destruction.\\nBilateral or generalized swelling suggests a systemic cause and is due\\n\\n430\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINEto the onset or exacerbation of chronic systemic conditions, such as conges-\\ntive heart failure, renal disease or hepatic failure, pulmonary hypertension, chronic renal or hepatic disease, protein-losing enteropathies, or severe malnutrition.\\nEdema can be an adverse effect of certain medications. The mecha-\\nnism often includes the retention of salt and water with increased capillary hydrostatic pressure (Table 47).\\nTable 47\\nEdema as an adverse effect of medication\\nClasses of drugs Medications\\nAntihypertensives Calcium channel blockers, clonidine, hydralazine, \\nmethyldopa, beta-adrenergic blockers\\nAntivirals Acyclovir\\nChemotherapeutics Cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine, mithramycin\\nHormones Androgen, corticosteroids, estrogen, progesterone, testosterone\\nNonsteroidal  antiinflammatory drugsDiclofenac, nimesulid, celecoxib, ibuprofen\\nLaboratory evaluation includes urinalysis with dipstick for proteinu-\\nria, testing principally detects albumin.The finding of a markedly positive \\ndipstick for protein in combination with hypoalbuminemia and clinical edema is virtually diagnostic of the nephrotic syndrome. False-positive results may be obtained with very alkaline or concentrated urines. Highly positive results (>300 mg/dL) cannot be explained by a concentrated and a very alkaline urine.\\nExamination of the urine sediment may also reveal hematuria, pyuria \\nand cellular casts. In the edematous patient with renal disease, different patterns of urinary findings favor different renal diseases. Hematuria with red cell casts with or without heavy proteinuria is a suspicion of poststrep-tococcal glomerulonephritis. The absence of red cell casts does not exclude the diagnosis.\\nHeavy proteinuria is most consistent with a noninflammatory cause \\nof nephrotic syndrome such as minimal change disease or focal segmen-tal glomerulosclerosis. Based upon the results of clinical history, physical examination and urinalysis, additional serum laboratory tests will be indi-cated (e.g. brain natriuretic peptide measurement in chronic heart failure).\\nIn nephrotic syndrome these will include compliment C3, C4, ANA, \\nand anti-double stranded DNA to screen for diseases such as membrano-\\n\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINE431\\nproliferative glomerulonephritis or lupus. If acute glomerulonephritis is \\nsuspected, the serum complement component 3 (C3) level is a useful test, as causes of glomerulonephritis can be classified as either hypocomplemen-temic or normocomplementemic.\\nThe presence of antistreptococcal antibodies is characteristic of post-\\nstreptococcal glomerulonephritis and antinuclear antibodies (ANA), antiglomerular basement membrane (GBM) antibodies, and antineutro-phil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA) favors the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome and vasculites. \\nIn chronic liver disease serologic screening for markers of viral infection \\nwill be performed. These include tests for hepatitis B (hepatitis B surface antigen and core antibody), hepatitis C (antibody), and HIV (antibody) infection. A diagnosis of chronic liver disease is suspected in a patient with hypoalbuminemia, but no proteinuria. In this setting, liver functions tests, total serum protein levels and prothrombin times should be performed.\\nStool level of alpha-1 antitrypsin is the best screening test for pro-\\ntein-losing enteropathy.\\nAngioedema assessment includes the evaluation of plasma levels of the \\ncomplement components, C1, C4, C2, and C1 inhibitor may help diagnose inherited or acquired C1 inhibitor deficiency. C4 and C2 levels are con-stantly low in this category of patients. If we are suspecting venous throm-bosis, coagulation studies should be obtained. If thrombosis is diagnosed, additional studies may include the measurement of antithrombin III and Factor V Leiden levels. \\nBased upon on the results of the clinical evaluation and laboratory find-\\nings the imaging studies will be indicated in differential diagnosis of edema (Table 48):\\n1. Chest radiography is helpful in detecting pulmonary edema\\n2. Doppler ultrasonography (or other studies assessing vascular flow) is indicated in patient with suspected venous thrombosis. A D-di-mer enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay can rule to deep venous thrombosis in low-risk patients. Duplex ultrasonography can also be used to confirm the diagnosis of chronic venous insufficiency\\n3. Magnetic resonance venography of the lower extremity and pelvis should be obtained in patients with unilateral left leg swelling and negative results on duplex ultrasonography if the suspicion for deep venous thrombosis persists.Compression of the left iliac vein by the right iliac artery (May-Thurner syndrome) should be suspected in\\n\\n432\\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS IN INTERNAL MEDICINETable 48\\nDifferential diagnosis of edema\\nPathological\\nstatus Characteristic features of edemaAspects of edema Confirmationof diagnosis\\nUnilateral edema\\nLipedema Chronic course, begins around or after puberty.Location: predominantly lower extremitiesNon-pitting edema; increased distribution of soft, adipose tissue, tibial tendernessClinical evalua-tion\\nMedication - induced edemaLocation: lower,weeks after initiation of med-ication, resolves within days of stopping the medicationSoft, pitting edema Clinical history of medication \\nObstructive sleep apneaChronic evolution, locat-ed on lower extremitiesMild, pitting edema associated with: day-\\ntime fatigue, snoring, \\nobesityClinical evalua-\\ntion,\\nHistory\\nPolysomnography\\nEchocardiography\\nBilateral edema\\nChronic venous\\ninsufficiencyChronic; begins in mid-dle to older age with location on lower extrem-ities, bilateral distribution in later stagesSoft, pitting edema Associated findings: venous ulcerations over medial malleolus.

Hypoxia and result-ant dyspnea occur preferentially in an upright position rather than in the recumbent position, as gravity exacerbates the ventilation-perfusion mismatch. The pathogenesis of hepatopulmonary syndrome is unclear, although it has been postulated that the diseased liver may not clear vaso-constrictors such as endothelin-1 or may produce some vasodilators such as NO.

It seems to depend on concomitant portal hypertension and excessive pulmonary vasoconstriction and vascular remodeling. The diagnosis may be suggested by echocardiog-raphy and confirmed by right heart catheterization. Patients with moderate to severe portopulmonary hypertension are difficult to treat with medical therapy, and the perioperative mortality with liver transplantation is high.\n",
      "Hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) refers to a functional renal failure \n",
      "sometimes seen during the terminal stages of liver failure with ascites. It is characterized by progressive azotemia, increased serum creatinine lev-els, and oliguria. In liver cirrhosis, congestion in the portal venous system due to narrowing of the vascular bed within the liver occurs initially. The hydrostatic pressure in the capillaries rises and excessive amounts of fluid are filtered into the abdominal cavity (ascites). Because of the high protein permeability of the liver sinusoid, plasma proteins are also lost into the extracellular space. In liver cirrhosis the loss of liver parenchyma and the increased amount of blood passing from the portal circulation directly into the systemic circulation, short-circuiting the liver, brings those substances into the systemic circulation unhindered. The mediators have a direct vas-odilator effect, while the endotoxins exert a vasodilator effect by stimulat-ing the expression of nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). This may lead to a fall in blood pressure, causing massive sympathetic stimulation. This, together with the hypovolemia, results in diminished renal perfusion and thus a fall in GFR. The reduced renal blood flow promotes the release of renin and thus the formation of angiotensin II, aldosterone and ADH. ADH and aldosterone increase the tubular reabsorption of water and sodium chloride (loss of potassium), and the kidney excretes small volumes of highly con-centrated urine (oliguria).\n",

      "DEFINITION. Heart failure is a clinical syndrome characterized by \n",
      "typical symptoms (e.g. breathlessness, ankle swelling and fatigue) that may be accompanied by signs (e.g. elevated jugular venous pressure, pulmonary crackles and peripheral oedema) caused by a structural and/or functional cardiac abnormality, resulting in a reduced cardiac output and/or elevated intracardiac pressures at rest or during stress.\n",
      "PATHOPHYSIOLOGY. HF with a reduced ejection fraction (EF) \n",
      "appears when there is decreased left ventricular (LV) stroke volume. The pumping capacity of the heart on three interrelated factors:\n",
      "• preload or venous return,\n",
      "• myocardial contractility,\n",
      "• afterload (impedance to forward flow).\n",
      "Any condition that impairs one or more of these factors can produce \n",
      "heart failure. A number of compensatory mechanisms become activated in the presence of cardiac injury and/or LV dysfunction allowing patients to sustain and modulate LV function for a period of months to years.\n",
      "The compensatory mechanisms include:• activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone (RAA) and adren-ergic nervous systems, which are responsible, respectively, for main-taining cardiac output through increased retention of salt and water,\n",
      "• increased myocardial contractility.\n",
      "There is an activation of vasodilatory molecules, including the atrial and \n",
      "brain natriuretic peptides (ANP and BNP), prostaglandins (PGE and PGI), and nitric oxide (NO), that counterpoise the excessive peripheral vascular vasoconstriction.

      "thickness and/or increased left atrial (LA) size as a sign of increased filling pressures. Patients have an additional ‘evidence’ of impaired LV filling or suction capacity (diastolic dysfunction), which is generally considered as the likely cause of HF in these patients (hence the term ‘diastolic HF’).\n",
      "Diastolic dysfunction is characterized by an inability of one or both \n",

The causes include: hypertension, valvular (aortic stenosis), cardiomyopathy (restrictive, hyper-trophic), presence of the metabolic syndrome and pericardial disease. Other comorbidities associated in HFPEF include atrial fibrillation (AF), sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal dysfunction, alcohol, inherited, dyslipidemia, systemic inflammatory diseases, such as rheuma-toid arthritis, and certain medications, including antineoplastic agents, amiloidosis, sarcoidosis, hemochromatosis, hypo– or hyperthyroidism.\n",

Classic symptoms and signs include rapid weight gain, polyuria, polydipsia, psychological disturbances, moon face, dorsicocervical fat pad, abdominal striae, and easy bruisability. In patients with typical symptoms, the diag-nosis is confirmed by the measurement of substantially elevated levels of cortisol from 24-hour urine samples.

The measurement of free cortisol from a 24-hour urine sample is the „gold standard” for the diagnosis of Cushing syndrome. Screening may also be performed using dexamethasone suppression, which includes intake of 1 mg of dexamethasone at midnight and measurement of the serum cortisol level at 08:00 the next morning. In outpatients late-night salivary cortisol can be assessed at midnight. At midnight, cortisol levels are low in healthy, unstressed individuals.\n",

      "The tachyarrhythmias mechanisms are:– enhanced automaticity (spontaneous depolarization of atrial, junc-tional, or ventricular pacemakers);\n",
      "– triggered arrhythmias (initiated by after depolarizations occurring during or immediate after cardiac repolarization, during phase 3 or 4 of the action potential);\n",
      "– re-entry (circus propagation of a depolarizing wavefront).\n",

Sinus pauses of up to 3 seconds are common in awake athletes and pauses of this duration or longer may be observed in asympto-matic elderly subjects. Intermitent failure of conduction from the SA node produces sinus exit block. Second-degree SA block will produce intermit-tent conduction from the SA node and a regularly irregular atrial rhythm. The function of the sinus node can be impaired (sick sinus syndrome) par-ticularly in elderly patients. This is usually expressed by the absence of heart rate increase as a response to physical exercise (chronotropic incompetence), sinus node pauses of over 3 seconds, or a marked increase in beat to beat variation (over 15% of cycle length).

The diagnosis of atrial fibrillation can be made if an absolute pulse arrhythmia is present, together with a pulse deficit (i. e., a higher pulse at heart auscultation than at palpation of the radial artery). Although VT are often fast and can lead to syncope, particularly in patients with structural heart disease, they can also be slower and hemodynamically well tolerated over hours and days. Conversely, supraventricular tachycardias, especially in patients with a normal heart, are usually better tolerated and may be ter-minated by the patient with coughing, pressure, or carotid sinus massage.\n",
      "Carotid sinus massage. Gentle pressure on the carotid sinus in the \n",
      "middle of the neck, provokes vagotonic stimulation, which slows impulse frequency from the sinus and AV node. This has diagnostic significance and is also a therapeutic maneuver, which can stop an arrythmia (e. g., during supraventricular tachycardia where the AV node is part of the reentrant cir-cuit). Focal arrhythmias can be slowed (atrial tachycardia) or flutter waves unmasked by slowing conduction over the AV node. Carotid sinus massage should also be performed in syncopal patients to detect bradycardia-in-duced AV block, a dangerous condition with a poor prognosis.\n",
      "PARACLINICAL EXAMINATIONSA resting 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) should be recorded \n",

      "with the analysis of the frequency of atrial (P waves) and ventricular (QRS complex) excitations and their relation. Then the size, width, and axis of P waves and QRS complexes should be analyzed. The repolarization phase (ST and T segments) and the presence of U waves can provide important information on the origin of arrhythmias. The duration of the longest QT interval should also be measured and corrected for the heart rate.\n",
      "Holter ECG. Continuous ECG monitoring over 24 or 48 hours can \n",
      "diagnose intermittent (paroxysmal) arrhythmias, provided that sympto-matic arrhythmia actually appears again during this time. The Holter ECG can give information about the function of the sinus node, detect pauses and the heart rate variability.\n",
      "Stress ECG. A continuous ECG recording during physical exercise \n",
      "(treadmill, bicycle) can provoke stress-induced arrhythmias or provide important information about increased sinus node rates (chronotropic competence) and the conduction properties of accessory pathways (delta waves in Wolff-Parkinson-White [WPW] syndrome).\n",

      "ence of low-amplitude late potentials, indicating a positive signal-averaged ECG, suggests an underlying abnormality in ventricular repolarization seen with a discrete scar and can be associated with ventricular ectopy and spontaneous VT. T wave alternans may have an important role for risk stratification in patients with LV dysfunction and complex ventricular arrhythmias.\n",
      "Electrophysiological investigation. The electrophysiologic study is an \n",
      "invasive procedure for the diagnosis of unclear arrhythmias and patients with syncope. It is also employed therapeutically for radiofrequency abla-tion treatment of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias (i. e., ther-mal ablation of the responsible focus or reentrant circuit). Electrophysio-logic testing has become an important standard for identifying high-risk patients who have nonsustained VT or inducible, sustained, monomorphic VT as a predictor for sustained VT and ventricular fibrillation. Electro-physiologic testing is the gold standard for evaluating patients with recur-rent syncope and can help identify underlying His-Purkinje disease, induc-ible VT, SVT, and sinus node dysfunction.\n",
